  <p>We could just create a large glowing white spot and call it our sun, but 
  that would be a pretty boring sun. Take a look the following view of the 
  sun...</p>
  <p align="center">
    <img border="0" src="12/1201.gif" width="470" height="418"></p>
  <p align="left">Yes, that is the actual sun. It was filmed using a special 
  filter that removes the glare and allows you to see the surface of the sun. 
  Notice that it is a very interesting and dynamic object. In this step, we are 
  going to try and create a sun that is similar to this one (ok, our sun will 
  not rotate, but it will look way more awesome).</p>
  <p align="left">Keep the following important fact in mind...</p>
  <p align="center"><b><font size="5"><a name="important"></a>YOUR SUN SHOULD REMAIN 
  SELECTED FROM DIRECTION 8 THRU DIRECTION 39. IF YOU HAPPEN TO DESELECT YOUR 
  SUN, YOU CAN RESELECT IT BY PRESSING AND HOLDING THE Ctrl KEY AND CLICKING 
  ON THE SUN LAYER'S THUMBNAIL</font><font size="4">. <br>
  </font></b>(A layer's thumbnail is the little picture between the eyeball 
  and the layer name)<br>
  <span class="style1"><font color="#000000">(Ctrl+thumbnail click will select all of the non-transparent pixels on 
  the layer)</font></span></p>
  <p align="left">In other words, if you begin work on your sun but have to stop 
  before you are finished and come back to it at a later time, then you will need 
  to reselect the sun before you can continue with the tutorial.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Open your <b>Space</b> 
  file in Photoshop</li>
    <li>Turn the <b>visibility</b> of the Star field and Nebula layer groups off 
    (they should both be locked)</li>
    <li><b>Insert</b> a new layer and name it <b>Sun</b> - make sure the Sun layer 
    is selected and is at the top of the layer stack...<br>
    <img border="0" src="12/1201.jpg" width="240" height="116"></li>
    <li>Press <b>D</b> on the keyboard to make sure <b>Set foreground color</b> is <b>black</b> and 
    <b>Set background color</b> is <b>white</b></li>
    <li>Set the <b>Zoom</b> to <b>100</b>% (the keyboard shortcut for this is 
    Ctrl+1)</li>
    <li>Select the <b>Elliptical Marquee Tool</b>...<br>
    <img border="0" src="12/1202.jpg" width="39" height="51"><br>
    If you do not see the Elliptical Marquee Tool, it is likely because you have 
    the Rectangular Marquee Tool selected - right-click the Rectangular Marquee 
    Tool and then select the Elliptical Marquee Tool...<br>
    <img border="0" src="12/1229.jpg" width="231" height="85"></li>
    <li>Make sure the <b>feather</b> is set to <b>0px</b>...<b><br>
    </b>
    <img border="0" src="12/1230.jpg" width="349" height="53"></li>
    <li>Press and hold the <b>Shift</b> key then <b>Click and drag</b> to create a circle in the center of your canvas 
    (holding the <b>Shift</b> key as you drag makes sure the circle is 
    perfectly round, if your sun is an oval you will lose points!) - the circle should be fairly large, remember that images 
    lose very little quality when shrunk but can lose a large amount of 
    quality when increased in size</li>
    <li> <b>Fill</b> the <b>CIRCULAR</b> selection with <b>black</b>...<b><br>
    </b>
    <img border="0" src="12/1203.jpg" width="379" height="388"></li>
    <li>Click <b>Filter</b> then point at <b>Render</b> and click <b>Difference 
    Clouds</b>...<b><br>
    </b>
    <img border="0" src="12/1204.jpg" width="431" height="445"></li>
    <li>Press <span class="style1"><b><font color="#000000">Ctrl+Alt+F</font></b><font color="#000000"> (this just reapplies the last filter you applied)</font></span> 
    multiple times until you get a pattern that you 
    like - try to get a pattern with some dark streaks  and lots of bright areas 
    - you should now have something similar to the image below...<br>
    <img border="0" src="12/1205.jpg" width="295" height="292"></li>
    <li>We need to make things a little brighter, so click <b>Image</b> then 
    point at <b>Adjustments</b> and click <b>Levels...</b></li>
    <li><b>Drag</b> the sliders so they are in approximately the same position as those 
    in the image below...<br>
    <img border="0" src="12/1206.jpg" width="674" height="380"><br>
    Don't try to make your sliders match mine exactly (your sun is different from 
    mine), instead move them to a 
    position that gives your sun a nice, unique pattern and a glow that you like</li>
    <li>Click <b>OK</b></li>
    <li>Click <b>Filter</b> then point at <b>Sharpen</b> and click <b>Unsharp 
    Mask...</b> <br>
    <img border="0" src="12/1231.jpg" width="412" height="455"><br>
    Despite its name, the Unsharp Mask Filter actually makes the image 
    sharper.....go figure.....</li>
    <li>Set the values to match those in the image below...<br>
    <img border="0" src="12/1207.jpg" width="332" height="446"><br>
    Notice that you now have a more detailed and interesting surface</li>
    <li>Click <b>OK</b></li>
    <li>The sun looks flat, so let's give it a more spherical look - click <b>Filter</b> then point at
    <b>Distort</b> and click <span class="style1"><b><font color="#000000">Spherize</font></b><font color="#000000"> (this filter causes the selection to 
    look like it is round)</font></span></li>
  <li>Set the Amount to <b>100</b>%...<br>
    <img border="0" src="12/1208.jpg" width="450" height="414"></li>
    <li>Click <b>OK</b></li>
    <li>Take a look at your sun and determine if you are happy with how 
    spherical it looks; if not, repeat the Spherize, but turn down the Amount 
    (most of you will want this second Spherize to have an Amount of 50%) - 
    when you are happy with how spherical it looks, move on...<br>
    <img border="0" src="12/1209.jpg" width="266" height="259"></li>
  </ol>
  <p>To give you an idea of the changes we just made, in the image below, the sun 
  on the left is what I had after direction 14 while the one on the right is 
  after applying the Unsharp Mask and Spherize filters...</p>
<p align="center">
    <img border="0" src="12/1210.jpg" width="499" height="254"></p>
<p align="left">
    Notice how the sun on the right looks waaaaay cooler and rounder. And here 
    is the really interesting part - despite the two suns being the exact same 
    size in the image above, the sun on the right appears to be slightly smaller 
    because it seems to be bulging out towards you. I know, awesome. Ok, let's 
    add some color.</p>
<ol start="22">
    <li>Click <b>Image</b> and point at <b>
    Adjustments</b> and click <b>Color Balance...</b> - we will need to change 
    each of the three settings pointed at with red arrows below...<b><br>
    </b>
    <img border="0" src="12/1211.jpg" width="461" height="267"><br>
    You need to change each value separately - keep in mind that since 
    everyone's sun pattern is different, you do not have to use the exact 
    numbers indicated in the next 3 directions; instead use them as the starting 
    point and make minor adjustments to the various values until you get a nice, 
    bright sun with a pattern you are happy with</li>
    <li>Click <b>Shadows</b> and change the <b>Color Levels:</b> settings to match the image 
    below...<br>

    <img border="0" src="12/1212.jpg" width="245" height="28" align="middle"></li>
    <li>Click <b>Midtones</b> and change the <b>Color Levels:</b> settings to match the image 
    below...<br>

    <img border="0" src="12/1212.jpg" width="245" height="28" align="middle"></li>
    <li>Click <b>Highlights</b> and change the <b>Color Levels:</b> settings to match the 
    image below...<br>

    <img border="0" src="12/1214.jpg" width="247" height="31" align="middle"></li>
  </ol>
  <p>You should now have a sun similar to the one below...</p>
<p align="center">
    <img border="0" src="12/1215.jpg" width="265" height="259" align="middle"></p>
<p align="left">Remember that what we are making is the image of a sun if you were looking 
    at it without the incredible glow around it, otherwise we could just make a 
    really large star using the Burn Tool, but that would be a sun with no 
    character, and where is the fun in that?</p>
<ol start="26">
    <li>Click <b>OK</b> on the Color Balance window</li>
  </ol>
  Because the original circle that we drew was an ordinary circle with a 
    hard edge, most of us now have a sharp edge that will make our sun stand out 
in our scene instead of blend in with the surrounding space, so 
    let's get rid of it.<ol start="27">
  <li>Make sure your sun is selected (if it is not, reread the 
    <a href="#important">important directions</a> at the top of this page)</li>
  <li>Make sure the <b>Elliptical Marquee Tool</b> is selected</li>
  <li>Click the <b>Select and Mask...</b> button...<br>
    <img border="0" src="12/1216.jpg" width="832" height="44" align="middle"><br>
  To open the Properties panel...<br>
    <img border="0" src="12/1217.jpg" width="282" height="687" align="middle"></li>
</ol>
  Notice that by default our selection is presented at 20% transparency (red 
arrow above). Let's adjust this so that our sun is solid.<ol start="30">
  <li>Adjust the <b>Transparency</b> setting...<br>
    <img border="0" src="12/1235.jpg" width="285" height="94" align="middle"><br>
  To <b>0%</b>...<br>
    <img border="0" src="12/1218.jpg" width="283" height="90" align="middle"><br>
  You sun should now be solid</li>
</ol>
  <p>Photoshop has the ability to detect what type of edge our selection has - 
  whether is it hard (like a table or piece of glass) or soft (like hair or fur). This 
  helps us to get as exact a selection as possible. If we turn on the Smart 
  Radius option, Photoshop will evaluate what is on either side of our selection 
  and try to determine exactly what it is. This is almost always a good thing. 
  Let's go ahead and turn this on so it will help us out.</p>
<ol start="31">
  <li>Click the menu arrow next to <b>Edge Detection</b>...<br>
    <img border="0" src="12/1233.jpg" width="283" height="200" align="middle"><br>
  to open the options</li>
  <li>Click the <b>Smart Radius</b> checkbox...<br>
    <img border="0" src="12/1219.jpg" width="284" height="129" align="middle"></li>
  <li>Set the <b>Edge Detection Radius</b> to <b>10.0 px</b>...<b><br>
  </b>
    <img border="0" src="12/1220.jpg" width="283" height="132" align="middle"></li>
</ol>
<p>With this setting, we are telling Photoshop to take a look at the area within 
10 pixels of our selection. We want to soften up our edge so that it appears to 
fade off into the distance, so let's increase the Feather (which simply blurs 
the edge a little).</p>
<ol start="34">
    <li>Change the <b>Feather</b> amount to <b>5</b> px...<br>
    <img border="0" src="12/1221.jpg" width="284" height="165" align="middle"></li>
    <li>We have a slight problem in that Photoshop is blurring from our current 
    edge out, but we want the actual edge to soften as well, so let's contract 
    (make smaller) the selection just a little bit by setting the <b>Shift Edge</b> 
    option to <b>-20%</b>...<br>
    <img border="0" src="12/1222.jpg" width="282" height="114" align="middle"></li>
    <li>Click <b>OK</b> to exit the Properties panel</li>
    <li>Click <b>Select</b> then click <b>Inverse</b> to select just the sharp 
    edge around your sun</li>
    <li>Press the <b>Delete</b> key to remove the sharp edge around your sun - 
    thanks to the feather setting we should now have a nice, soft edge to our 
    sun</li>
    <li>Press <b>Ctrl+D</b> to deselect the sun</li>
    <li>Turn the <b>visibility</b> of your Nebula layer group on so you can see 
    your sun against a dark background - you should 
    have something like the image below...<br>
    <img border="0" src="12/1223.jpg" width="200" height="189" align="middle"></li>
  </ol>
  <p>Our sun is looking pretty good at this point, but we still need to give it 
  a corona (the glowing part just above the surface of the sun)</p>
<ol start="41">
    <li><span class="style1"><b><font color="#000000">Double-click</font></b><font color="#000000"> the Sun layer</font></span> where 
    indicated below...<br>
    <img border="0" src="12/1237.jpg" width="240" height="76" align="middle"><br>
    <span class="style1"><font color="#000000">This opens the Layer Style window</font></span>...<br>
    <img border="0" src="12/1224.jpg" width="800" height="484" align="middle"></li>
  <li>Click the <b>Outer Glow</b> option (red arrow above)</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Be careful when working with the Layer Style window. You will only see the 
  settings for each option if that option is highlighted in gray, as Outer Glow 
  is above. Note that it is possible to turn options on and off by clicking the 
  checkbox without actually selecting the option, so be sure that you have each 
  option selected - it is in gray - before you try to adjust its settings.</p>
<ol start="41">
    <li>We only need to make a few changes here: change the <b>color</b> to a 
    light orange, and increase the <b>Size</b> option to 75...<br>
    <img border="0" src="12/1225.jpg" width="623" height="363" align="middle"></li>
    <li>Click <b>OK</b></li>
    <li>You should now have something similar to the image below...<br>
    <img border="0" src="12/1226.jpg" width="300" height="300" align="middle"></li>
    <li>Use the <b>Move Tool</b> to place your sun in a corner of your space scene - it 
    doesn't matter which corner you put it in, but be sure that what is showing 
    has more bright areas than dark (keep in mind that if you want it in a 
    specific corner but don't like the part of the sun showing on that corner 
    that you can always rotate the sun [click <b>Edit</b> - <b>Transform</b> - 
    <b>Rotate</b>]<b> </b>until an area that you like if visible)</li>
    <li>Click <b>Edit</b> then point at <b>Transform</b> and click <b>Scale</b> 
    and resize your sun (<i>remember to hold down the <b>Shift</b> key as you resize your 
    sun so that you are changing the height and width at the same time</i>) to make 
    it the 
    size you would like it to be - remember, this is your sun so it needs to be 
    large, but how large is up to you (don't make it too large or too small as 
    it will look unnatural)</li>
    <li><b>Click</b> and <b>drag </b>the<b> </b>Sun layer onto the <b>Create a new group</b> icon</li>
    <li><b>Rename</b> the new layer group <b>Sun</b>...<br>
    <img border="0" src="12/1227.jpg" width="240" height="97" align="middle"></li>
    <li><b>Lock</b> the Sun layer group</li>
  </ol>
  You should now have something similar to the image below - notice that I 
    flipped my sun around so that what is mostly visible is the brightest 
    portion...<p align="center">
    <img border="0" src="12/1228.jpg" width="500" height="501" align="middle"></p>
  <p>We are now ready to add some planets to our space scene. We will make two 
  different planets using similar procedures, with one requiring you to use an 
  existing image and the other allowing you to build the planet entirely from 
  scratch. I know...awesome.</p>
