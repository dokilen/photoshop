  <p>We will be creating 
  our second planet completely from scratch. This is a lengthy step with lots of 
  directions, so read the directions carefully and follow along as we will cover 
  lots of great Photoshop tools and techniques. The planet we are going to 
  create will resemble the planet Saturn, 
  complete with an awesome set of rings, but will have colorful bands of gas like Jupiter. 
  Yeah, I know, I can't wait to get started either.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Open your <b>Space</b> file in Photoshop</li>
    <li>Turn <b>off</b> the visibility of all of your current layers (you should see 
    the checkerboard)</li>
    <li><b>Insert</b> a new layer and name it <b>Planet2Original</b> (the reason 
    we are giving this layer such a strange name will become obvious in just a 
    moment)...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/14991.jpg" width="240" height="160" align="middle"></li>
    <li>Select the <b>Elliptical Marquee Tool</b></li>
</ol>
  <p>The first thing we need is a circle to put our bands of gas in. For 
  everything to work correctly, we are all going to have to use the same sized 
  circle, so let's first make sure everyone is using the same measurements.</p>
  <ol start="5">
    <li>Click <b>Edit</b> and point at <b>Preferences</b> (at the very bottom) and click <b>Units &amp; 
    Rulers...</b><br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1401.jpg" width="460" height="171" align="middle"></li>
    <li>In the <b>Units</b> section, click the drop-down arrow next to <b>Rulers</b> 
    and select <b>Pixels</b>...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1402.jpg" width="179" height="102" align="middle"><br>
    If Pixels is already selected then leave it alone</li>
    <li>Click <b>OK</b></li>
    <li><b>Place</b> your cursor near the upper left hand corner of your image 
    (but do not place it on the very corner or you will have problems later)...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1403.jpg" width="187" height="78" align="middle"></li>
    <li>Press and hold the <b>Shift</b> key then <b>click and drag</b> down and to 
    the right until you have created an <b>800 pixel Wide x 800 pixel High</b> circle...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1404.jpg" width="517" height="430" align="middle"><br>
    Keep an eye on the black box pointed at with the red arrow above as this 
    will let you know how big of a circle you are creating (yes, this is a big 
    circle - you will resize it later) and <b>release</b> the mouse button and then 
    the Shift key 
    when you have an <b>800x800</b> circle (if you can't get it to go exactly to 800 px 
    don't worry about it - just get as close to 800 as you can)</li>
    <li>Press <b>D</b> to set your foreground color to black</li>
    <li>Press <b>Alt+Backspace</b> to fill the circle 
    with black</li>
  </ol>
  <p>At this point we are going to do some quick maintenance on our file to help 
  avoid problems later on. This Step works much like the previous two Steps in 
  that you will need to keep the circle you just created selected for most of 
  this Step. The problem is that we are going to be doing some extensive 
  modifications to our planet and the edges of our circle will become distorted. 
  Let's make a copy of our current layer so that we always have a layer with our 
  original circle on it just in case we lose our selection and need to get it back.</p>
<ol start="12">
  <li>Right-click the <b>Planet2Original</b> layer and select <b>Duplicate 
  Layer...</b></li>
  <li>Name the new layer <b>Planet2</b>...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/14992.jpg" width="447" height="217" align="middle"></li>
  <li>Click <b>OK</b> - notice that Photoshop places this new 
  layer above the Planet2Original layer...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/14993.jpg" width="241" height="141" align="middle"><br>
  This is what we want at this point as 
  the Planet2Original layer exists just in case we mess up</li>
</ol>
  <div style="border-style: solid; border-width: 1; padding-left: 4; padding-right: 4; padding-top: 1; padding-bottom: 1">
  <p align="center"><b><font size="4">Your planet should remain 
  selected:</font></b></p>
  <p align="center"><b><font size="4">from direction 9 through direction 49,<br>
  from direction 65 through direction 76,</font></b><font size="4"><b><br>
  from direction 98 through direction 119.</b></font></p>
  <p align="center"><b><font size="4">If you happen to deselect your planet, you 
  can reselect it by pressing and holding the Ctrl key and clicking on 
  Planet2Original's layer thumbnail</font></b></p>
</div>
<ol start="15">
  <li><b>Lock</b> the Planet2Original layer</li>
  <li>Make <b>Planet2</b> the active layer</li>
  <li>We will be using a gradient to simulate the bands of gas that wrap 
    around the surface of the planet, so click the <b>Gradient Tool</b>...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1405.jpg" width="39" height="49" align="middle"><br>
    If you do not see the Gradient Tool, just right-click the <b>Paint Bucket Tool</b> 
    and select the Gradient Tool</li>
    <li>Click the <b>drop-down arrow</b> on the <b>Click to edit the gradient</b> 
    box...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1406.jpg" align="middle" width="282" height="188"><br>
    to open the gradient selection window</li>
    <li>Click on the <b>tiny gear</b>...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1407.jpg" align="middle" width="270" height="122"><br>
    to open the gradient fly-out menu</li>
    <li>
    In the list of gradient presents click on <b>Noise Samples</b>...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1408.jpg" align="middle" width="171" height="439"><br>
    This set of gradients will give us a planet with lots of thin bands of color</li>
    <li>An alert window will open asking you if you really want to replace the 
    current gradients with the Noise gradients...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1409.jpg" align="middle" width="391" height="126"><br>
    Click <b>OK</b> - notice that the gradient choices are now different...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1410.jpg" align="middle" width="267" height="123"></li>
    <li><b>Click</b> the Sunrise gradient...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1411.jpg" align="middle" width="265" height="143"><br>
    If you do not like the colors in this gradient don't worry, you will change them later to something 
    different (this just gives us a nice, 
    simple set of various colors to work with)</li>
    <li>Make sure <b>Linear Gradient</b> is selected...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/14997.jpg" align="middle" width="267" height="123"></li>
    <li> <b>Click</b> on the gradient box...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1412.jpg" align="middle" width="265" height="133"><br>
    to bring up the gradient editor...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1413.jpg" align="middle" width="455" height="482"></li>
    <li>Make sure the <b>Restrict Colors</b> checkbox is selected...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1414.jpg" align="middle" width="422" height="164"><br>
    This option will prevent our image from having too much color in it which 
    could make our planet look unnatural</li>
    <li>Click <b>OK</b></li>
    <li>To apply the gradient, make sure you still have the black circle 
    selected (you should see the moving dashed line around it) then <b>click just 
    above your circle</b> and <b>press and hold the Shift key</b> on the keyboard as you 
    drag down to create a line stopping just below the black circle...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1415.jpg" align="middle" width="381" height="388"><br>
    Your gradient should now be applied to your circle...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1416.jpg" align="middle" width="188" height="186"></li>
</ol>
  <p>So far everything is looking pretty good, but if you look at real gas 
  giants out in space (like Saturn and Jupiter) you notice that they have 
  distortions in their bands of gas...</p>
  <p align="center">
    <img border="0" src="14/1417.jpg" align="middle" width="621" height="186"></p>
  <p>In other words, they do not have clean, straight 
  lines across their surfaces. Let's take a quick minute to give our planet a little 
  character by distorting the lines just a bit.</p>
<ol start="28">
  <li>Click <b>Filter</b> then point at <b>Distort</b> and click <b>Ripple...</b><br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1418.jpg" align="middle" width="421" height="373"><br>
&nbsp;to open the Ripple window...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1419.jpg" align="middle" width="420" height="412"></li>
  <li>Set the <b>Amount</b> to something between <b>200</b> (any less and you 
  won't be able to see the ripples after you resize your planet) and <b>300</b> (any more and the surface just begins to look like mush) - I'm going to use 
  <b>250</b> - and leave the <b>Size</b> set to <b>Medium</b></li>
  <li>Click <b>OK</b></li>
</ol>
<p>Our lines no longer look perfect, but they are still pretty straight across 
the planet. Let's add some waviness to our clouds.</p>
  <ol start="31">
    <li>Click <b>Filter</b> then point at <b>Distort</b> and click <b>Wave</b> to 
    open the Wave window...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1420.jpg" width="549" height="402" align="middle"></li>
    <li>Use the above settings as a starting point, and adjust the numbers until 
    you get something that you like (avoid simply using my numbers as you want 
    your planet to be unique and if everyone uses the same numbers then all 
    of the planets will look the same), but keep the following in mind:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; Set Type, Scale, and 
    Undefined Areas to the same settings as the image above<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; Number of Generators determines how large the 
    waves are - setting this number too high will make your planet look like a 
    cartoon, so try each number between 1 and 5 to see what gives you a result 
    you like (your waviness should look something similar to the image above)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; Set  Wavelength Max. to any number 
    between 100 (closer together waves) and 400 (more spread out waves)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; Set  Amplitude Max. to any number 
    between 20 (shallow waves) and 50 (deep waves)<br>
    I'm going to use the numbers in the above image - keep in mind that we will be resizing our planet later in this step so 
    it is ok if the waves are a little exaggerated right now, they will look 
    fine when we resize</li>
    <li>Click <b>OK</b></li>
  </ol>
  <p>You should now have some nice, wavy, slightly distorted lines that more 
  closely resemble the actual surface of a gas giant...</p>
<p align="center">
    <img border="0" src="14/1421.jpg" width="343" height="176" align="middle"></p>
<p align="left">
    Keep in mind that since you (should have) used different settings than me 
    that your bands of gas will not look exactly like mine.</p>
<p align="left">
    You may also notice that your planet's edge appears to have some chunks 
    taken out of it...</p>
<p align="center">
    <img border="0" src="14/1422.jpg" width="293" height="53" align="middle"></p>
<p align="left">
    Don't panic - this is actually what we want at this point. The ripple and 
    wave filters that we applied have distorted our edge, and we will worry 
    about fixing this a little later on. For now, just keep going.</p>
<p>Scroll back up to the picture of Jupiter and Saturn and notice that the actual 
surface of both planets have a lot more distortions on their surface than our 
planet does. Let's take a quick second to add in some additional variations to 
our clouds (and learn some new tools in the process).</p>
  <ol start="34">
    <li>Click <b>Filter</b> and then click <b>Liquify...</b><br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1423.jpg" width="284" height="235" align="middle"><br>
    to open the Liquify window...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/14994.jpg" width="500" height="335" align="middle"><br>
    Yes, it's a big window</li>
    <li>In the Liquify window, press the <b>W</b> key to activate the <b>Forward 
    Warp Tool</b>...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1424.jpg" width="34" height="31" align="middle"></li>
    <li>Use the <b>Zoom tool </b>at the bottom of the Liquify window to change 
    the zoom to <b>100%</b>...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1425.jpg" width="237" height="65" align="middle"></li>
    <li>Under <b>View Options</b>, deactivate the <b>Show Backdrop</b> 
    checkbox...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1426.jpg" width="347" height="236" align="middle"><br>
    This will allow us to clearly see our changes without the background 
    blending in to our surface</li>
    <li>Under <b>Brush Tool Options</b>, make the following settings...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1427.jpg" width="398" height="143" align="middle"></li>
    <li><b>Click</b> and <b>drag</b> quickly in your clouds in various directions and at 
    various lengths to simulate variations in the surface gas...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1428.jpg" width="493" height="144" align="middle"><br>
    <b>DO NOT</b> go crazy with your warps - try to space them out as we will be 
    decreasing the size of the brush in the following directions and adding 
    additional warps of various sizes to give our planet a lot more character</li>
    <li>Use the <b>scroll bars</b> to move your planet around and warp various 
    locations - be careful not to draw too close to the edges of your planet as 
    you do not want your warps to stretch out of the basic circle of your planet</li>
    <li>Press the <b>[</b> key on your keyboard twice to decrease the size of 
    your brush from <b>35</b> to <b>25</b></li>
    <li><b>Add</b> in some additional warps - again, don't over do it</li>
    <li>Press the <b>[</b> key on your keyboard twice to decrease the size of 
    your brush from <b>25</b> to <b>15</b></li>
    <li><b>Add</b> in some additional warps - this time you can make as many as you 
    like (you can even draw onto some of the previous warps)</li>
    <li>Press the <b>]</b> key ten times to increase the brush size to <b>80</b></li>
    <li>Select the <b>Pucker Tool</b>...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1429.jpg" align="middle" width="33" height="32"><br>
    This tool pulls whatever is within your brush circle 
    in to the center of the circle</li>
    <li>Change the Brush Rate to 30...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1430.jpg" align="middle" width="392" height="123"><br>
    This controls how quickly the surrounding area is pulled into the center of 
    your circle - if this is set too high then you pretty much have no control 
    over how much pucker you apply</li>
    <li><b>Click</b> around your planet in a few different places - this tool 
    works great to repair any areas that you went crazy on - to add some 
    additional distortions to your clouds (keep in mind that the longer you 
    press the mouse button on one spot the more Photoshop will draw the 
    surrounding area into your circle) - once again, do not go crazy with this</li>
  </ol>
  <p>The Pucker Tool is a great way to create thinner bands of gas...</p>
<p align="center">
    <img border="0" src="14/14998.jpg" align="middle" width="260" height="65"></p>
<p align="left">Simply click and hold the Pucker Tool as you drag along a band 
of gas to thin it out.</p>
  <ol start="49">
    <li><b>Look</b> back over your planet and make sure that you are happy with the 
    warps you have created - you should have something similar to the image 
    below...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1431.jpg" align="middle" width="200" height="200"><br>
    When you are happy with your planet, click <b>OK</b> to exit the Liquify window</li>
  </ol>
  What might be awesome at this point is to add in a nice storm such as the 
Great Red Spot on Jupiter...<p align="center">
    <img border="0" src="14/1432.jpg" align="middle" width="206" height="167"></p>
<p align="left">This spot on Jupiter is actually a huge hurricane that has been 
churning for decades, maybe even centuries.
    Let's start by creating a selection to contain our storm.</p>
<ol start="50">
  <li><b>Select</b> the Elliptical marquee tool - make sure Feather is set to 0</li>
  <li><b>Draw</b> a circle over the empty area of your image (NOT on your planet) that is 
  <b>200px 
  wide</b> by <b>100px high</b>...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1433.jpg" align="middle" width="267" height="177"><br>
  Don't waste a lot of time trying to get your selection to be exactly 200x100 - 
  just get close</li>
  <li><b>Determine</b> where on your planet you would like your storm to be - it 
    should on the same side of the planet as your sun (in other words, if you 
    put your sun on the right side of your image like I did then you want your 
    storm to be on the right side of your planet since we are going to shade the 
    other side later in this step and you want your storm to be visible) and looks best when placed in darker bands of color 
  (if you place it over light colored clouds it will be difficult to see when 
  you resize your planet)</li>
  <li><b>Click</b> inside the selection (your cursor should look like this:
    <img border="0" src="14/1434.jpg" align="bottom" width="29" height="32"> 
  while over the selection) and <b>drag</b> it onto the area of your planet that you 
  chose...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1435.jpg" align="middle" width="369" height="102"></li>
  <li>Click <b>Filter</b> then point at <b>Distort</b> and click <b>Twirl...</b><br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1436.jpg" align="middle" width="421" height="425"><br>
  to open the Twirl window...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1437.jpg" align="middle" width="450" height="377"></li>
  <li>Set angle to <b>300 degrees</b> as in the image above</li>
  <li>Click <b>OK</b></li>
  <li><b>Click</b> on your selection oval and drag it to the right (or left depending 
  on how close you are to the edge of your planet) <b>100 pixels</b> - as you drag 
  Photoshop will display an indicator box letting you know how far left/right 
  and up/down you are moving the selection...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1438.jpg" align="middle" width="473" height="209"><br>
  In the graphic above,  
    <img border="0" src="14/1439.jpg" align="middle" width="12" height="10"> 
  indicates that I have moved my selection oval to the right, and
    <img border="0" src="14/1440.jpg" align="middle" width="34" height="14"> 
  let's me know that I have moved it 100 px (if you need to move your oval to the left to keep it on the 
  planet that is fine, just know that in that case the tiny little arrow will be 
  pointing to the left) and
  <img border="0" src="14/1441.jpg" align="middle" width="54" height="14"> indicates that I have not moved it up or down (be 
  sure you don't move your selection oval up or down!)</li>
  <li>Reapply the <b>Twirl</b> <b>filter</b> (use the same settings as before) - you should now have something like this...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1442.jpg" align="middle" width="437" height="135"></li>
  <li><b>Click</b> on your selection oval and drag it <b>50 pixels</b> back toward your 
  original twirl so it sits between the two twirls you just 
  made...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1443.jpg" align="middle" width="446" height="154"></li>
  <li>Click <b>Filter</b> then point at <b>Distort</b> and click <b>Twirl</b> to reopen the Twirl 
  window, but this time set the angle to <b>400 degrees</b>...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1444.jpg" align="middle" width="289" height="47"><br>
  This should combine the first two twirls into one large twirl...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1445.jpg" align="middle" width="408" height="188"></li>
  <li>Press <b>Crtl+D</b> to deselect the oval</li>
</ol>
<p>You may be wondering why we didn't just create one large twirl at an angle of 400  
and be done with it. Remember that the bands of gas on our planet (and on the 
real gas planets in our solar system) are created due to the planet spinning 
really fast and, because there is no solid ground to provide friction, stretching the gas 
across the surface of the planet. Because of this, a simple round storm would 
look out of place. By applying two small twirls and merging them with one large 
twirl we are able to create a storm that is definitely noticeable, but that 
blends into the surrounding clouds and looks stretched out so that it could 
actually be on our planet and not look like some weird artificial storm we 
stuck on same fake planet using Photoshop (and now you know why the Great Red 
Spot on 
Jupiter is an oval...you're welcome).</p>
<p>Let's make one more minor adjustment before we move on. If you look at the 
Great Red Spot on Jupiter in the image above you will notice that the center is 
far less defined (it's blurrier) than the center of our storm. We have a 
quick fix we can use to soften up the center of our storm.</p>
<ol start="62">
  <li>Click the <b>Smudge Tool</b>...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1446.jpg" align="middle" width="40" height="52"><br>
  You may have to right-click the Blur Tool and then select the Smudge Tool...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/14995.jpg" align="middle" width="158" height="63"></li>
</ol>
  <p>The Smudge Tool does exactly what the name says: it smudges. It works very 
  much like what happens when you stick your finger in a dab of paint and move 
  it around - the paint smudges (sorry, really no better way to say it).</p>
<ol start="63">
  <li>Choose the <b>Soft Round</b> brush and make the Size <b>70 px</b></li>
  <li><b>Click</b> in the center of your storm and move your mouse back and 
  forth slightly (do not go too far or you will begin to remove the oval shape 
  of the storm) until your center is well blended - it should look something 
  similar to the image below...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1447.jpg" align="middle" width="435" height="193"></li>
</ol>
  Now let's give our planet a quick spherize so that the bands of gas seem to be 
moving around an actual round surface instead of sitting across the flat surface 
they actually do. We will do this the same way we did it on the first planet. We 
need to first reselect our planet shape.<ol start="65">
    <li>Press and hold the <b>Ctrl</b> key and click on the <b>Planet2Original</b> 
    layer's thumbnail...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1448.jpg" width="240" height="88" align="middle"><br>
    This will select all of the non-transparent pixels on the layer - in other 
    words, it selects the black circle (see, I told you the Planet2Original 
    layer would come in handy)</li>
    <li>Make sure the <b>Planet2</b> layer is the active layer</li>
    <li>Click <b>Filter</b> then point at <b>Distort</b> and click <b>Spherize</b></li>
    <li>Set the <b>Amount</b> to <b>100%</b> and click <b>OK</b> - this should 
    smooth out most of the jagged areas along the edge of your planet</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Your planet should look pretty nice, but depending on what settings you 
  used when you applied the Wave your edge may have some distorted sections...</p>
<p align="center">
    <img border="0" src="14/1449.jpg" width="282" height="70" align="middle"></p>
<p>Unfortunately, 
there are no gas planets with chunks taken out of their edges like 
this (remember that the missing pieces are black because the Planet2Original 
layer is filled with black and is still sitting behind our Planet2 layer), so let's take a second to fix any of these issues.</p>
  <ol start="69">
    <li>Click <b>Select</b> then point at <b>Modify</b> and click <b>Contract...</b><br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1450.jpg" width="366" height="354" align="middle"><br>
    This will open the Contract Selection window</li>
    <li>Set <b>Contract By:</b> to <b>5</b> pixels...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1451.jpg" width="299" height="120" align="middle"></li>
    <li>Click <b>OK</b></li>
</ol>
<p>Look carefully at your planet's edge - contracting by 5 pixels should fix most 
edge distortions, but you may need to contract a little more...</p>
<p align="center">
    <img border="0" src="14/14996.jpg" width="475" height="111" align="middle"></p>
  <ol start="72">
    <li>If your planet still has edge problems, simply <b>repeat</b> the Contract 
    Selection until all of your problem areas are outside your selection circle</li>
    <li>Once you are happy with your selection circle, click <b>Select</b> then 
    click <b>Inverse</b>...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1452.jpg" width="226" height="141" align="middle"><br>
    This will select everything on your Planet2 layer <b>EXCEPT</b> the part of the 
    planet you want to keep</li>
    <li>Press the <b>Delete</b> key on the keyboard to remove everything on the 
    layer except your planet - you should now see a black outline around your planet...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1453.jpg" width="246" height="54" align="middle"></li>
</ol>
  <p>This black outline is the Planet2Original layer, which you will remember is 
  totally black and now slightly larger than our Planet2 layer. Since the edge 
  of our Planet2 layer is now smooth, we can turn off the visibility of the 
  Planet2Original layer.</p>
  <ol start="75">
    <li>Turn the visibility of the Planet2Original layer off</li>
    <li>Press <b>Ctrl+D</b> to deselect everything</li>
</ol>
  <p>You should now have an awesome looking gas planet with a nice smooth edge 
  (if you still have some small nicks here and there in your edge don't worry 
  about it as they will not be noticeable when we resize the planet). Since this planet is covered with all kinds of strange gasses and doesn't 
  have clouds like we do on earth, we don't have to worry about creating cloud 
  layers and just need to apply a nice glow to 
  the Planet2 layer.</p>

  <p>We still need to add in a shadow. Since we applied a layer style, we are

</ol>
<p>Things are looking pretty good, but at this point all of your planets look 
pretty much the same, which is pretty boring. Let's take a second to modify the color of 
your 
planet so that everyone has a unique planet. We could simply take our Planet2 
layer and edit the colors directly, but doing so would permanently change our 
planet. If we close our image or continue on with <a href="step15.html">Step 15</a>, 
we would be 
unable to get our planet back to the way it currently looks or to modify any changes 
we made. Luckily for us, Photoshop offers a way to modify a layer without doing 
so permanently. This can be done with an <b>adjustment layer</b>.</p>
<p> 
    <span class="style2"><font color="#000000">Adjustment layers are layers that sit over other layers and make some sort of 
  change to them</font></span>. The good thing about adjustment layers is that unlike 
    actually changing a layer, changes made using adjustment layers can be 
    quickly and easily undone (by deleting the adjustment layer) or easily 
    changed (by modifying the adjustment layer).</p>
<p> 
    We need to give our planet a color scheme we like at this point because 
    later we will be adding a ring system and will need to apply color to the 
    rings based on the color of our planet's swirling clouds. We are going to 
    need a new layer that sits above our Planet2 layer.</p>
<ol start="120">
  <li>Turn off the <b>visibility</b> of the Shadow layer - this will allow you 
  to 
  better see what impact the color change is having on your planet</li>

    <img border="0" src="14/1474.jpg" width="287" height="378" align="middle"></li>
  <li>Drag the <b>Hue slider</b> (red arrow in the image above) left and right and keep an eye on your planet - notice 
  your planet will actually change colors - and stop when you get to a color 
  scheme you like...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1475.jpg" align="middle" width="226" height="219"><br>
  No, your planet does not have to look like mine...again, choose something that 
  YOU like</li>
  <li>Drag the <b>Saturation</b> slider left and right and determine if you want 
  your colors to be more or less vivid</li>
</ol>
<p>The adjustment layer we are creating actually impacts all layers sitting under it, so we need to limit its 
  effect to only the layer immediately below it.</p>
<ol start="126">
  <li>Look at the bottom of the Hue/Saturation Properties panel and locate the icon 
  pointed at with the red arrow below...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1476.jpg" align="middle" width="287" height="93"><br>
  and
  <b>click it</b></li>
</ol>
<p>Clicking the above icon creates a Clipping Mask.
<b>Clipping Mask</b> is just a fancy way to say that
    <span class="style2"><font color="#000000">any adjustments we make will be applied only to the 
layer directly below the current layer. Photoshop actually 
has a couple of ways to let us know that we are using a Clipping Mask. Look at 
your Layers panel...</font></span></p>

is being modified by the Clipping Mask directly above it.</font></span></p>
<p><span class="style2"><font color="#000000">Adjusting the Hue/Saturation

  distinct red tint (which is the default color)...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1479.jpg" align="middle" width="167" height="167"></li>
</ol>
<p>At this point you might be thinking: huh, what's going on? Colorize is a 
great tool to use when we want to add color to an image that has no color (such 
as a black and white image). Using it now causes our planet to be
monochromatic (a variation of one color). You have a choice to make now 
about whether you like the monochromatic look or if you prefer the multi-colored 
bands.</p>
<ol start="128">
  <li>Drag the <b>Hue</b> slider to the right to modify the color being applied to your 
  image - if you find a color scheme you like then go to the next direction 
  right now, if you prefer the multi-colored bands simply click back on the 
  Colorize checkbox to turn the Colorize option off</li>
  <li>Click the <b>collapse panel icon</b>...<br>

</ol>
<p>We have one more thing we can do to ensure we have a one-of-a-kind planet.</p>
<ol start="130">
  <li>Change the <b>blending mode</b>...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1481.jpg" align="middle" width="239" height="107"><br>
  of the Hue/Saturation adjustment layer - try each blending mode until you find 
  one that you like (do not use Hard Mix as this looks too unnatural) - once you 
  find a setting you like leave it set to that (you are certainly free to use 
  the default Normal setting if you like it best)</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Keep something very important in mind at this point - if you do not like any 
of the 
adjustments you have made you can always make changes to your adjustment layer. 
Take a look at your Layers panel and locate the icon pointed at with the red 
arrow below...</p>
<p align="center">
    <img border="0" src="14/1482.jpg" align="middle" width="239" height="99"></p>
<p align="left">This icon indicates that the layer is modifying the 
Hue/Saturation of our image (if you are wondering what that white box to the right of the 
Hue/Saturation icon is for, it is there to indicate what specific parts of our 
image are being adjusted, and since this particular adjustment layer is being 
applied to the entire image, the entire box is white; if something had been 
selected when we applied the adjustment layer, our planet for example, then our 
layer would look like this...</p>
<p align="center">
    <img border="0" src="14/1483.jpg" align="middle" width="239" height="103"></p>

You simply need to double-click on this funny looking little icon to get the 
Hue/Saturation Property panel from direction 123 to pop back up. This is the 
real power of adjustment layers - we can make tons of changes to our image 
without having a direct impact on our layers.</p>

    <li>Click <b>Filter</b> then point at <b>Distort</b> and click <b>Twirl</b> 
    - the Twirl window will open...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1487.jpg" width="450" height="377" align="middle"></li>
    <li>Change the <b>Angle</b> to <b>999</b> as in the image above</li>
    <li>Click <b>OK</b></li>
    <li><b>Repeat</b> the above <b>3</b> steps <b>three</b> more times until your image looks 
    like the one below...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1488.jpg" width="252" height="252" align="middle"></li>
    <li>Click the <b>Elliptical Marquee Tool</b> and make sure the Feather 
    option is set to <b>20px</b></li>
    <li>Press and hold both <b>Shift</b> and <b>Alt</b> (<span class="style1"><b><font color="#000000">Shift</font></b><font color="#000000"> gives us a circle 
    while <b>Alt</b> forces the point we click to be the center of our circle</font></span>) then 
    click in the center of your twirl and drag to create a selection similar to 
    the one below...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1489.jpg" width="502" height="502" align="middle"><br>
    Then release Shift, Alt, and the mouse button</li>
    <li>Click <b>Select</b> then click <b>Inverse</b></li>
    <li>Press the <b>Delete</b> key to remove the twirl outside the selection - notice that you should have a nice soft edge on the remaining selection (if you don't, start your rings over and make sure the feather is set to 20px as in direction
    <b>143</b> above)</li>
    <li>Press <b>Ctrl+D</b> to deselect</li>
    <li>Change the <b>Feather</b> to <b>0px</b></li>
    <li>Press and hold both <b>Shift</b> and <b>Alt</b> then click in the center 
    of your twirl and drag to create a selection similar to the one below...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1490.jpg" width="502" height="502" align="middle"><br>
    Don't waste a lot of time trying to make your selection perfect, just get 
    close to the selection above</li>
    <li>Press the <b>Delete</b> key to remove the twirl inside the selection</li>
    <li>Press <b>Ctrl+D</b> to deselect</li>
    <li>You should now have something similar to the image below...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1491.jpg" width="252" height="252" align="middle"></li>
    <li>Make sure the <b>Planet2</b> layer is visible and turn off the 
    visibility of the <b>Shadow</b> layer (otherwise it will be difficult to 
    tell how wide to make your rings)</li>
    <li>Select the <b>Rings</b> layer and click <b>Edit</b> then click <b>Free 
    Transform</b>...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/14910.jpg" width="274" height="165" align="middle"></li>
    <li>Use the top (or bottom) center resize handle to squish your rings into 
    an oval, and then adjust their width so that they are slightly wider than your planet, 
    and then tilt them <b>at 
    the same angle</b> as your gas bands - your rings should look similar to the 
    image below...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1492.jpg" width="242" height="219" align="middle"></li>
    <li>When you are happy with your rings press the <b>Enter</b> key</li>
</ol>
Our rings are really smooth, so let's make them look a little more rock-like.<ol start="157">
    <li>Click <b>Filter</b> then point at <b>Noise</b> and click <b>Add Noise...</b></li>
    <li>Make your settings match those below...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1493.jpg" width="330" height="199" align="middle"></li>
    <li>Click <b>OK</b></li>
    <li>Click <b>Image</b> then point at <b>Adjustments</b> and click <b>
    Hue/Saturation</b></li>
    <li>Set Saturation to <b>-100</b> and leave everything else alone</li>
</ol>
<p>This will remove any color that may be present in our rings.</p>
<ol start="162">
    <li>Click <b>OK</b></li>
    <li>Click <b>Image</b> then point at <b>Adjustments</b> and click <b>Levels</b></li>
    <li><b>Change</b> the settings to something similar to those in the image below...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1494.jpg" width="423" height="379" align="middle"><br>
    Feel free to adjust them to something you like</li>
    <li>Click <b>OK</b></li>
</ol>
In reality, light bounces off the planet and gives the rings a slight color, so 
let's give our rings a slight tint.<ol start="166">
    <li>Click <b>Image</b> and point at <b>Adjustments</b> and click <b>
    Hue/Saturation</b> and change the settings so that the rings have a nice, 
    slight tint to them that resembles your planet's color (if you drag the 
    sliders and the color of your rings does not change, make sure you have 
    <b>Colorize</b> checked in the lower right-hand corner of the Hue/Saturation 
    window)...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1495.jpg" width="240" height="218" align="middle"><br>
    Everyone has different colors in their planet, so I can't tell you exactly what settings to use - just play around with them until  you get something you like 
    (remember, it needs to look realistic, so after adjusting the Hue be sure to 
    adjust the Saturation so your rings do not have too much color)</li>
    <li>Click <b>OK</b></li>
    <li>Turn the <b>visibility</b> of your <b>Shadow</b> layer on (you still want the Rings layer 
    to be selected, just make sure you can see the Shadow layer so you know 
    where to erase the rings)</li>
    <li>Click the <b>Eraser Tool</b> and erase the part of the rings that are 
    behind the planet, and remove some of the rings that are in the planet's 
    shadow (the rings will look more realistic if you leave some slightly visible in the 
    shadow - this can be easily done by turning the Opacity and 
    Flow settings in the Eraser Tool options bar down to 50% each and gradually 
    removing the rings until you have something you like)...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1496.jpg" width="241" height="218" align="middle"></li>
  <li><b>Select</b> all five of the layers that make up your second planet...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1497.jpg" width="241" height="232" align="middle"></li>
  <li>Click 
    the <b>Create a new group</b> icon</li>
    <li><b>Rename</b> the new layer group <b>Planet2</b>...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1498.jpg" width="241" height="149" align="middle"></li>
    <li>Click <b>Edit</b> then point at <b>Transform</b> and click <b>Scale</b> 
    and resize your planet (remember to hold the Shift key as you drag one of 
    the corners to resize both the height and width as the same time) to something that fits your scene then move it where you would like it to be 
    (remember that you can still use Edit - Transform - Flip Horizontal/Vertical 
    to reposition your planet if you need to, just remember that you may need to 
    rotate it again to keep the shadow away from the sun)</li>
    <li><b>Lock</b> all of your layer groups</li>
</ol>
With all of your layer groups and layers turned on, you should now have a space 
    scene similar to the one below...<p align="center">
    <img border="0" src="14/1499.jpg" width="500" height="499" align="middle"></p>
<p>So far it looks pretty good, but there are all kinds of other things floating 
through space such as comets and asteroids, so let's add in some of those.</p>
