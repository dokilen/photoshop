<p>We can now begin to create a nice, black outline version of our picture. We will work first on the 
long, unbroken lines in the image. We could simply draw our face freehand (and we 
will do some of this in the next step), but Photoshop has a built-in system that will 
create smooth, perfect lines for us. This is accomplished using <b>Path Inking</b>. Path inking can seem pretty intimidating at first. It can seem like a horrible, 
technical, time-consuming, and complicated process. But, once you get a good sense of how to use the 
Pen tool, it really is easy to work with, comes in handy, and the lines it makes are pretty much flawless.</p>
<p>Before we get started, let's make sure we have the correct layer selected.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open your <b>Face</b> file in <b>Photoshop</b></li>
  <li>Make sure the <b>Freehand</b>, <b>Backing</b>, and <b>Face</b> layers are 
  all 
  <b>locked</b>...<br>
  <img border="0" src="05/501.jpg" width="242" height="176"></li>
  <li>Make sure the <b>Cartoon</b> layer is selected (it 
  should be highlighted in gray like in the image above)</li>
</ol>
<p align="center"><i><font size="5"><b>DRAW ONLY ON THE CARTOON 
LAYER - THIS IS </b></font><b><font size="6">VERY IMPORTANT!</font></b></i></p>
<p>If your Face layer is unlocked and you draw your cartoon lines on it then the lines you draw will merge with the blue 
image 
and will be impossible to separate,</p>
<p align="center"><b><font size="5">AND YOU WILL HAVE TO
</font><font size="6"><i>START OVER</i></font></b>.</p>
<p>When working with Photoshop, be sure that all changes you make are being 
placed on the correct layer. By keeping our cartoon and photograph layers separate 
we can turn the visibility 
of  our photo on and off as needed to see  our progress and compare the cartoon we 
are making with our original image.</p>
<hr>
<p>The two tools we'll be using are the <b>Pen</b> tool (about halfway up the Tools 
panel) and the 
<b>Direct Selection</b> tool (just under the Type tool). We'll be using the Pen tool to draw points and the 
Direct Selection tool to modify them.</p>
<p>When we create <span class="style1"><font color="#000000">Paths, we are drawing temporary lines that Photoshop remembers which will serve as a guide for 
Photoshop to drop ink over</font></span>. The really cool thing is that we can create, delete, or move points on these lines before 
we ink them, so we are able to make the lines look exactly the way we want before we add in the 
color. 
Think of it as using a string to create a shape on the floor, then moving the string around any way 
we want to create any shape we want. Once we have the string in a position we like, we use 
a 
can of 
spray paint to paint over the string to create a line (except Photoshop does the 
painting for us!).</p>
<p>We first need to set our brush to the correct size.</p>
<ol start="4">
  <li>Activate the <b>Brush Tool</b>...<b><br>
  </b>
  <img border="0" src="05/502.jpg" width="41" height="59"><b><br>
  </b>The resulting <b>Option</b> bar (at the top of the Photoshop window just 
  below the Menu bar) will look 
  similar to the one below...<br>
  <img border="0" src="05/503.jpg" width="656" height="34"></li>
  <li>Make sure <b>Mode</b>, <b>Opacity</b>, and <b>Flow</b> are set to match 
  the image above</li>
  <li>Click the <b>drop-down arrow</b> next to the Brush 
  Preset picker 
    (in the image above, the Brush Preset picker is currently set to 2)</li>
  <li>Change the amount in the <b>Size</b> box 
    to <b>4</b>, as indicated below (top red arrow)...<br>
  <img border="0" src="05/504.jpg" width="280" height="305"></li>
</ol>
<p align="center"><b><font size="5">A BRUSH SIZE OF 4 IS CRUCIAL FOR YOUR 
CARTOON FACE TO COME OUT RIGHT. <br>
MAKE SURE YOUR BRUSH IS SET TO 4.</font></b></p>
<ol start="8">
  <li>Select the brush indicated above (bottom red arrow) - you can tell which 
  brush is selected because it will have a blue box around it</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's begin creating the outline of your face.</p>
<ol start="9">
      <li>Select the <b>Pen</b> tool...<br>
      <img border="0" src="05/505.jpg" width="40" height="62"></li>
  <li>Go up to the Pen Tool options bar, and look at 
      the left side where you see this...<br>
      <img border="0" src="05/506.jpg" width="232" height="34"><br>
      We need to make sure the correct tools are activated or the changes we 
  will be making to our graphic in the following steps will not work</li>
      <li>We want to make a path, so make sure the <b>Pick 
      tool mode</b> selector is set to <b>
      Path</b> (notice the word Path in the above image - you want your screen 
      to have the exact same selection)</li>
    </ol>
<p align="center"><font color="#008080" size="4">
      <b><i>THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT - IF YOU DO NOT SELECT PATH
ALL KINDS OF 
STRANGE THINGS WILL HAPPEN,
SO FOLLOW THESE DIRECTIONS CAREFULLY!</i></b></font></p>
Let's start creating our paths just above your ear.
When using the Pen tool, clicking the left mouse button places an anchor point. If you drag the 
mouse a little bit while holding the mouse button  down, you can set its starting 
direction. <b>You need to make sure that you ALWAYS set a starting direction because if you don't the path will just be a straight line to the next point you make 
and the curves it makes will stink</b>. So the 
starting direction line is how you get Photoshop to make nice, pretty curves. If you look at the image below you will see a box with lines coming out the 
top and bottom with small dots at the end of them - the box is the anchor point that I dropped and the lines are the direction lines (when you drag the mouse, the direction lines are drawn an 
equal distance on each side of the anchor point). 
Remember that if you 
    put an anchor in the wrong place, you can hit the <b>Delete</b> key to get rid of it.
    <ol start="12">
      <li>If you skipped the paragraph above, go back and <b>READ IT</b> as it 
      contains important information you need to know about the Pen tool</li>
      <li>Make sure once again that you are on the correct layer - your
      <strong>Cartoon</strong> layer should currently be highlighted in blue and 
      the other two layers should be locked</li>
      <li><b>Left click</b> just above your ear and while <b>holding down</b> the mouse button <b>drag</b> it up a little bit in the direction you want the path to 
      go (this will get the direction line to 
      display) then <b>release</b> the mouse button </li>
      <li>You should now have something similar to the 
      image below...<br>
      <img border="0" src="05/507.jpg" width="182" height="170"><br>
      If you just clicked and didn't drag, just delete that point and do it 
      correctly - if you don't get the direction line it will be difficult to 
      create nice, smooth lines</li>
      <li>Look at the layers in your Layers panel - check once more to make sure you are actually drawing paths on the <strong>
      Cartoon</strong> layer and that the other two layers are locked - if the Cartoon layer 
      is not the active layer then click it to make it the active layer now (it should be highlighted in blue)</li>
      <li>Move about half way up the side of your face and <b>click 
      again</b> then:</li>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="6"></a></font><b>Drag</b> the mouse 
      around until the line between the 
      two points you created matches the curve of your face - note that at this point you can move the mouse 
      up and down or left and right to get the line that Photoshop inserted 
      between the two points to curve how you like it</li>
    </ol>
    <table width="73%" border="1" align="center" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" bordercolor="#111111" style="border-collapse: collapse">
      <tr>
        <td width="100%"><p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman"> If you do not have a line but instead have a strange shape that is filled in with <br>
        black, 
        take a look at your Layers panel and see if it looks something like this...<br>

                  <img border="0" src="05/509.jpg" width="242" height="121"><br>
        Now go back and actually follow the directions to redo it.</font></td>

    </table>
        <ol start="19">
      <li><b>Click</b> at the top of your head and drag

      <img border="0" src="05/510.jpg" width="242" height="257"></font></li>
    </ol>
<p>When working with paths, we want to keep the lines simple and not too 
complicated. In the graphic above you can see that I am only using 3 points to 
create the curve and that I am only doing half of the top of his head. I could 
certainly do more of the head at once, but by using short, easy to work with 
lines I can make sure that I make an accurate outline.</p>
<p align="center"><font size="4"><b>A WORD OF WARNING AT THIS 
POINT:<br>
</b></font>
<b>Do not drop too many points!<br>
</b> If you have too many points your line will 
actually look more jagged than if you use few points and let Photoshop add in a 
nice curved line.</p>
<p align="center">If your points look like this...<br>
      <img border="0" src="05/511.jpg" width="265" height="264"><br>
then your line will look like this...<br>
      <img border="0" src="05/512.jpg" width="274" height="264"><br>
Notice that the above line is not smooth at all, especially when compared to the one 
below...<br>
      <img border="0" src="05/513.jpg" width="272" height="264"><br>
which was created using only 3 points. <b>Make sure your 
lines are smooth!</b></p>
<p> <b>The Pen Tool is a difficult concept for some users to master, so don't worry 
    too much if you have a hard time getting it to work correctly.</b> <i><b>Keep practicing and it will work.</b></i> 
  Using a Path means you will have very clean, very neat lines.</p>
    <p>Once all the 
    anchors of the line you want to create are in place, you can go back and fine-tune them. Keep in 
    mind that your Path should <b>NOT</b> attempt to outline or draw too much of the image, as this will 
    likely result in problems. Keep your pathing to easy, smooth lines you can 
    work with.</p>
    <p>Let's fine-tune our points.</p>
    <ol start="20">
      <li>Click the <b>Direct 
      Selection Tool</b> (this tool allows us to adjust the points we placed with our Pen Tool)...<br>
      <img border="0" src="05/514.jpg" width="39" height="44"><br>
      If you don't see the Direct Selection Tool it is because the Path 
      Selection Tool is currently selected - right-click the Path Selection Tool 
      and in the menu that pops up...<br>
      <img border="0" src="05/526.jpg" width="204" height="56"><br>
      Select the Direct Selection Tool</li>
      <li><b>Press and hold the Alt key</b> then <b>roll 
      the mouse wheel up</b> to <b>zoom in</b> so you can see the entire path 
      and some of the area around 
      it (basically what you see in direction 19 above) - keep in mind that you will want to see at least some of the surrounding area as this will 
      help you when setting up your lines and curves</li>
      <li>Click to select any of the three points that need to be adjusted (when attempting to select a point, Photoshop may select the entire 
      path when you first click on a point; you can correct this by clicking a little distance away 
      from a point and dragging to draw a selection box around the point you want to 
      select)</li>
      <li>You should now be able to move the anchor and both the ingoing and 
      outgoing curve vectors (those lines coming off the point in each direction) 
      - this method of curves is very flexible, so <b>take your time</b> and make 
      sure your curve is perfect</li>
    </ol>
<p>Before we stroke our path, let's make sure that we are drawing with black 
ink.</p>
    <ol start="24">
      <li>Locate the <b>Default Foreground and Background 
      Colors</b> icon (red arrow below)...<br>
      <img border="0" src="05/515.jpg" width="41" height="85"></li>
      <li><b>Click the icon</b> - this will make Black 
      your Foreground color and white your Background color (the keyboard 
      shortcut for this is the <b>D</b> key)</li>
</ol>
<p>When you have a curve you are happy with - and black as your color - it's 
time to ink the line.</p>
    <ol start="26">
      <li>With either the <b>Pen Tool</b> or the <b>Direct 
      Selection Tool</b> selected, <b>Right-click</b> your image - this will 
      open a pop-up menu</li>
      <li>Click <b>Stroke Path...<br>
      <img border="0" src="05/516.jpg" width="291" height="139"><br>
      </b>If Stroke Path... is grayed out so you can not click it, be certain you do 
      not have the Shape layer problem that was described in <font color="#800000"> <a href="#6">
      direction 18</a></font> and that the Cartoon layer is the active layer (your 
      other layers should be locked so Photoshop should not allow you to edit 
      them)</li>
      <li>The <b>Stroke Path</b> window will open...<br>
      <font color="#800000">
      <img border="0" src="05/517.jpg" width="372" height="127"></font></li>
      <li>Make sure that <b>Tool:</b> is set to <b>Brush</b>, and
      <b>Simulate Pressure</b> is <b>NOT</b> checked</li>
      <li>Click <b>OK</b></li>
    </ol>
<p>Photoshop should have just inked (dropped black ink on top of) the path you 
created and you should see something like this...</p>
<p align="center">
    <img border="0" src="05/518.jpg" width="202" height="151"></p>
<p>If your line is a color other than black or is too wide/thin, simply press 
Ctrl+Z on the keyboard to undo the inking and fix your issues using the above 
directions.</p>
<p>Once the line looks good we no longer need the path so we can get rid of it.</p>
    <ol start="31">
      <li>Either click on the path and press the delete key, select <b>Delete Path</b> from the Path menu, 
      or right-click your drawing and choosing <b>Delete Path</b>...<br>
    <img border="0" src="05/519.jpg" width="291" height="105"><br>
      Right-clicking and choosing Delete Path is the way 
      most Photoshop users do it</li>
</ol>
<p>You should now have something like this...</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="05/520.jpg" width="232" height="235"></p>
    <p>We are now ready to path 
    ink the rest of your head.</p>
    <ol start="32">
      <li>Be sure all previous paths you created have been
      <b>deleted</b></li>
      <li><b>Start</b> where your last path ended and <b>
      click and drag</b> to begin creating a new path - don't worry if the two 
      ends of the paths do not line up exactly, we will worry about that later</li>
      <li><b>Create</b> a path that goes from the top of 
      your head to the other side of your head - remember, don't try to path ink 
      too much at once</li>
      <li><b>Stroke</b> the path - you should now have 
      something similar to the image below...<br>
<img border="0" src="05/521.jpg" width="232" height="240"></li>
      <li><b>Ink</b> the remainder of the outline of your 
      head...<br>
    <img border="0" src="05/522.jpg" width="191" height="221"><br>
      Remember to ink it a piece at a time - perhaps do one 
      cheek, then your chin, then the other cheek, then one ear, then the other 
      ear</li>
</ol>
<p>Keep in mind that while the Pen tool is good for the long, important lines, 
    <b>it should not be 
    used for every line in the picture!</b> It could be, but if your pictures 
    have many small lines like this one, you would simply be driven insane. 
    These small lines don't need the detail of the longer ones, so you would be 
    better off drawing them freehand with the mouse (which we will do in the 
    next step)</p>
    <ol start="37">
      <li>Continue using the <b>Pen</b> tool to ink the 
      remaining <b>long</b> lines of your face - you want to do the following 
      parts:<ul><li> the outline of your face (which we did above)</li><li> ears 
        (if they are visible)</li>
      <li>hairline across your forehead</li>
      <li>your eyebrows</li>
      <li>shape of each eye</li>
      <li>nose</li>
      <li>mouth<li>outline of your neck - you will be 
  placing your face inside a spaceship in a later step, and if you have no neck 
  your face will appear to float...and a floating face flying through space is 
  just ridiculous</ol>
  <font color="#800000">
  </ul>
            </font>
<p align="left">When you finish the above step, you will have something like 
    this...
    <p align="center">
    <img border="0" src="05/523.jpg" width="286" height="330"><p align="left">Keep something very important in mind at this point - <b><font size="4">your cartoon needs to extend to the bottom of the 
image</font></b>. This will be very important to us when we create our Backing 
layer in <a href="step08.html">Step 08</a>...</p>
<p align="center">
    <img border="0" src="05/524.jpg" width="191" height="220"><br>
    <font size="2">We need to be able to select all of the pinkish area at once</font></p>
<p align="left">Notice that in the picture I'm using for this tutorial 
that the lines of the neck go all the way to the bottom of the image so that the 
entire head is one contained unit. This will allow me to quickly and easily 
select everything around my head with one click so that we are only left with 
our cartoon noggin. If you have long hair that extends out the bottom of the 
photo you can ink that, if not you will have to ink and add color to your 
clothes. Take a look at the two outlines below...</p>
<p align="center">
    <img border="0" src="05/525.jpg" width="647" height="327"></p>
<p align="left">
    In the left image, her hair was long enough that it extended out the bottom 
    of the image and thus no additional work on her clothes needed to be done. 
    In the right image however, she had to add paths to her jacket and blouse so 
    that the cartoon extended all the way to the bottom of the image. It does 
    not matter at this point how you accomplish this, just make sure that your 
    paths extend all the way to the bottom of the picture.</p>
<p align="left">
At this point our cartoon is not perfect - we are missing some important parts around the eyes and ears, 
but these are short lines that will take a long time to get in if we use paths, 
so we will simply freehand ink them in the next step.<ol start="38">
