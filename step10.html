  <p>The first thing we need to create is a star field that will sit behind our 
  planets, sun, asteroids, and other stuff in our image. We are actually going 
  to create 4 different levels of stars to give  our space scene a feeling of 
  depth and make it look awesome.</p>
  <p align="center"><font color="#FFFFFF">
  <span style="background-color: #000000"><span style="font-weight: 700">FOLLOW 
  THE DIRECTIONS BELOW CAREFULLY</span></span></font></p>
  <ol>
    <li>Open your <b>Space</b> file in Photoshop</li>
    <li>Let's start by making sure we are using solid black as our Foreground 
    color -
  <span class="style2"><font color="#000000">Press <b>D</b> on the keyboard - this is the keyboard shortcut 
  to reset the Foreground and Background colors to 
  their default colors (black and white)</font></span></li>
    <li>Use the <b>Paint Bucket Tool</b> to fill <b>Layer 1</b> 
    with black  </li>
  </ol>
  <p>Our only layer at this point is named Layer 1 instead of <i>
    Background</i> because we chose Transparent for the Background 
    Contents option in the New file window in <a href="step09.html">Step 09</a>. 
  This saves us from having to convert the layer. Yeah us.</p>
  <ol start="4">
    <li><b>Lock Layer 1</b> as we will not be editing it at all during this step 
    but leaving it in the background so we always have some black to see our 
    stars</li>
    <li>At the bottom of the <b>Layers</b> panel, click the <span class="style1">
    <font color="#000000">Create a new layer</font></span> button...<br>
    <img border="0" src="10/1001.jpg" width="240" height="227"></li>
    <li><b>Double-click</b> the new layer's name to select the name and rename the 
    layer <b>Far Stars</b> (if the Layer Style window pops up simply use the red X 
    to close it and try again, but be sure you are actually clicking on the layer's 
    name) - you should now have the following layers...<br>
    <img border="0" src="10/1002.jpg" width="240" height="109"></li>
    <li>Pr<span class="style3">ess <span class="style2"><b>
    <font color="#000000">Alt+Backspace</font></b><font color="#000000"> to fill the <b>
    Far Stars</b> layer with black (this i</font></span></span><span class="style2"><font color="#000000">s the keyboard shortcut to fill the current selection with the 
    foreground color</font></span> - I know, cool huh?)</li>
    <li>Make sure the <b>Far Stars</b> layer is selected (it should be highlighted 
    in gray in the Layers panel - see the image above)</li>
    <li>Press Ctrl++ (the Ctrl key and the + key) on the keyboard to set the <b>Zoom</b> level to <b>100%</b>...<br>
    <img border="0" src="10/1003.jpg" width="246" height="30"></li>
    <li>Click <b>Filter</b> then point at <b>Noise</b> and click <b>Add Noise...<br>
    </b>
    <img border="0" src="10/1045.jpg" width="417" height="331"><b><br>
    </b>The Add Noise window appears...<br>
    <img border="0" src="10/1046.jpg" width="330" height="459"></li>
    <li>Make your settings match the image below...<br>
    <img border="0" src="10/1004.jpg" width="330" height="459"><br>
    Remember that these settings are not set in stone - you can adjust them to 
    whatever you like when you are working with your own images in the <b> <i>future</i></b>, 
    but for now let's all use these settings as they will allow us to create quick, 
    simple stars<br>
    <b>NOTE</b>: Make certain that you have Monochromatic checked. If 
    Monochromatic (which simply means we are working with a variation of one 
    color, in this case white) is unchecked we will get a field of noise that 
    includes red, yellow, blue, purple, and other colors...<br>
    <img border="0" src="10/1043.jpg" width="285" height="168"><br>
    This will create unrealistic multi-colored stars and destroy the illusion of our amazing 
    space scene</li>
  </ol>
  <p>When Photoshop applies the Noise filter it generates a random noise pattern. 
  In other words, everyone will have a different noise pattern and thus will 
  have a unique layout of stars.</p>
  <ol start="12">
    <li>Click <b>OK</b></li>
  </ol>
  We need to duplicate the Far Stars layer at this point so that we can simulate 
some stars that are nearer to us and brighter.<ol start="13">
    <li> <b>Right-click</b> the Far 
    Stars layers and click <b>Duplicate Layer...</b></li>
    <li><b>Rename</b> the new layer to <b>Near Stars</b> and click OK</li>
    <li>Lock the Near Stars layer then turn its visibility off - you should now 
    have the following layers...<br>
    <img border="0" src="10/1005.jpg" width="241" height="144"><br>
    We will work on our Far Stars layer first and come back to the Near Stars 
    layer a little later on</li>
    <li><a name="gaussian"></a>Make the <b>Far Stars</b> layer the active layer - it should be highlighted in 
    gray...<br>
    <img border="0" src="10/1006.jpg" width="240" height="134"></li>
  </ol>
  <p>The 'stars' we are making are very sharp and crisp at this point, so let's 
  soften them up a little to help them look like they are actually glowing balls 
  of gas.</p>
  <ol start="17">
    <li>Click <b>Filter</b> then point at
    <b>Blur</b> and click <b>Gaussian Blur...</b> - the Gaussian Blur window 
    opens...<br>
    <img border="0" src="10/1047.jpg" width="332" height="344"><br>
    <span class="style2"><font color="#000000">Gaussian Blur tends to make images appear softer or slightly out of 
    focus</font></span></li>
    <li>Make your settings match the image below...<br>
    <img border="0" src="10/1007.jpg" width="332" height="345"></li>
    <li>Click <b>OK</b></li>
  </ol>
  <p>To turn this static into stars, we are going to use the Levels editor - 
  yes, the same one we used when we turned our face blue - to remove most of the 
  white and be left with a random spattering of dots which will be our stars.</p>
<ol start="20">
    <li>Click <b>Image</b> then point at <b>Adjustments</b> and then click <b>
    Levels</b></li>
    <li>Click the <b>black Input Level slider</b> (red arrow below)...<br>
    <img border="0" src="10/1034.jpg" width="290" height="197"><br>
    and drag it slowly to the 
    right (the gray slider will move to the right automatically) - notice 
    as you drag that the noise starts to go away - stop dragging at around 
    <b>215</b></li>
    <li>Click the <b>white Input Level slider</b> (the one on the right) and drag it slowly to the 
    left - notice as you 
    drag that the stars become brighter and more refined - stop dragging around 
    <b>235</b> - you should now have this...<br>
    <img border="0" src="10/1008.jpg" width="778" height="575"><br>
    Yes, the three sliders are really close together</li>
  </ol>

</div>
  <ol start="23">
    <li>Click <b>OK</b></li>
    <li> <b>Zoom</b> out to <b>50%</b> - your current star field should look 
    something like this...<b><br>
    </b>
    <img border="0" src="10/1010.jpg" width="500" height="500"></li>
  </ol>
  <p>Notice that our stars are distributed fairly evenly around our image. In 
  reality, there are sections of the sky that appear to the naked eye to have no 
  stars. Let's take a second and give our space scene a small section or two of 
  emptiness.</p>
  <ol start="25">
    <li>Click the <b>Eraser Tool</b>...<br>
    <img border="0" src="10/1011.jpg" width="41" height="50"></li>
  </ol>
  <p>We don't want to use a simple round brush to create our areas of empty 
  space as it will be obvious that we have removed stars because there will be 
  hard edges to our emptiness, so let's choose a more random brush.</p>
  <ol start="26">
    <li>Click the <b>Brush Preset picker</b> option and 
    select the <b>Dry Brush Tip Light Flow</b> brush...<br>
    <img border="0" src="10/1012.jpg" width="294" height="373"><br>
    You will have to scroll down the brush list to find the correct shape</li>
    <li>Change the <b>Size</b> to <b>200 px</b>...<br>
    <img border="0" src="10/1013.jpg" width="281" height="87"></li>
    <li>Make sure you are on the Far Stars layer (the other two layers should be 
    locked) and <b>click</b> randomly in a few places to remove some stars - keep in mind that the eraser you are using has a 
    very scattered shape so that you can create dark areas that are not 
    necessarily totally dark but still contain a very scattered group of stars, so 
    if you want to create a truly empty area you will need to do repeated clicks and drags 
    over the same area to 
    totally remove everything</li>
  </ol>
  <p align="center"><font size="5"><b>DO NOT GO CRAZY WITH THIS!!</b></font></p>
  <p>We 
  just want to remove a few stars here and there. Look at the two images 
  below...</p>
<p align="center">
    <img border="0" src="10/1014.jpg" width="920" height="457"></p>
<p>Notice that you really have to look hard to notice where the areas of empty 
space are. If you look at the Far Stars layer's thumbnail image on the Layers 
panel (the red arrow in the image 
below)  
you can see exactly where you removed the stars because you will be able to see 
white spots...</p>
<p align="center">
    <img border="0" src="10/1015.jpg" width="241" height="151"></p>
<p>This is what we want at this point - later we will be adding more stars and 
these few blank areas will become more noticeable.</p>
<hr>
<p>Now that we've got some stars that appear dim and far away, let's create some 
average looking stars that appear to be a little closer to us. To pull this off 
we simply have to make a duplicate of our Far Stars layer and then break out our 
Eraser Tool again.</p>
  <ol start="29">
    <li><b>Lock</b> the Far Stars layer</li>
    <li><b>Right-click</b> the <b>Far Stars</b> layer and click <b>Duplicate 
    Layer</b></li>
    <li>Name the duplicate layer <b>Average Stars</b>...<br>
    <img border="0" src="10/1016.jpg" width="446" height="216"></li>
    <li>Click <b>OK</b></li>
  </ol>
  <p>At this point, each layer is actually covering up every other layer. With 
  multiple layers of stars, it would be great to have a way to see what is 
  under a layer while still being able to see the contents of that layer. Lucky 
  for us 
  blending modes are a thing.</p>
  <ol start="33">
    <li><b>Unlock</b> the Average Stars layer</li>
    <li>Click the <b>Set the blending mode for the layer</b> drop-down arrow 
    (red arrow below) and select <b>Linear Dodge (Add)</b>...<b><br>
    </b>
    <img border="0" src="10/1017.jpg" width="386" height="279"><b><br>
    </b>This allows us to 
    see what is below this layer</li>
  </ol>
  <p>The Linear Dodge (Add) blending mode allows us to see through the black on 
  the layer to what's underneath it. OK, to be totally honest here, Linear Dodge 
  (Add) actually does more than make black see-through, but for what we are 
  doing now, knowing that it allows us to see-through black is good enough. Notice that 
  many of the stars are now brighter because we actually have two identical 
  images on top of each other and they are complimenting each other to make the 
  stars brighter. We now need to remove most of the stars from the Average Stars 
  layer so that we have some dim stars that appear far away (now you know why we 
  named the first layer Far Stars) and some brighter stars that seem closer (the 
  Average Stars layer). A few directions from now we will get some stars that 
  appear very near to us as well as some awesome bright stars.</p>
  <ol start="35">
    <li>Make sure the <b>Average Stars</b> layer is the active layer (all other 
    layers should be locked and the visibility of the Near Stars layer should be 
    off)</li>
    <li>Click the <b>Eraser Tool</b></li>
    <li><b>Erase</b> most of the stars from your Average Stars layer - remember 
    to keep an eye on the layer's thumbnail on the Layers panel to see where and how 
    much of your Average Stars you are removing - you want to end up with 
    something like this...<br>
    <img border="0" src="10/1018.jpg" width="240" height="148"><br>
    You can turn the visibility of the Average Stars layer on and off to see 
    exactly what impact this layer is having on your star field</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Don't worry about trying to remove stars from your Average Stars layer in 
  the same patter as I 
  did - try to be unique. As the direction above stated, you want to remove most of your Average 
  Stars so that what's left will work with the Far Stars layer to give your star 
  field some depth. If you leave too many Average Stars you end up with stars 
  that all look the same. Your star field should now look something like this...</p>
<p align="center">
    <img border="0" src="10/1019.jpg" width="498" height="499"><br>
    <i>
<font size="2">Note that your stars will NOT look like mine</font></i></p>
<p>We have some pretty awesome looking far and average stars, so let's add in a 
few near stars to complete the sense of depth.</p>
  <ol start="38">
    <li><b>Lock</b> the Average Stars layer</li>
    <li>Turn the <b>visibility</b> of the Near Stars layer on and <b>unlock</b> it 
    - note that when you do this that your image should now covered with 
    noise...<br>
    <img border="0" src="10/1048.jpg" width="464" height="106"></li>
    <li>Click <b>Filter</b> then point at
    <b>Blur</b> and click <b>Gaussian Blur...</b></li>
    <li>Set the <b>Radius</b> to <b>2</b> Pixels - this will make your noise 
    really blurry - and click <b>OK</b></li>
    <li>Click <b>Image</b> then point at <b>Adjustments</b> and then click <b>
    Levels</b>...<b><br>
    </b>
    <img border="0" src="10/1035.jpg" width="425" height="379"></li>
    <li>Drag the <b>black Input Level slider</b> to the 
    right and stop at <b>145</b>...<b><br>
    </b>
    <img border="0" src="10/1036.jpg" width="300" height="147"></li>
    <li>Drag the <b>white Input Level slider</b> to the 
    left as far as it will go...<br>
    <img border="0" src="10/1037.jpg" width="272" height="104"><br>
    Notice that it stops automatically at <b>147</b>...<b><br>
    </b>
    <img border="0" src="10/1049.jpg" width="282" height="109"><b><br>
    </b>
    The closest you can make the black and white sliders 
    is two numbers apart</li>
    <li>Click <b>OK</b></li>
  </ol>
  <p>Notice that you have only a few stars that are slightly larger than those 
  on the Far Stars and Average Stars layers...</p>
<p align="center">
    <img border="0" src="10/1020.jpg" width="499" height="500"></p>
<p>This is good - this is what we want at this point. </p>
  <ol start="46">
    <li>Change the <b>blending mode</b> of the <b>Near Stars</b> layer to <b>
    Linear Dodge (Add)</b> - you should now be able to see all of the stars in 
    your image</li>
  </ol>
  <p>We do have a slight issue at this point. Recall that we made a copy of our 
  noise filled layer all the way back in direction 13, so at this point all of 
  our layers have stars sitting in the exact same place. If we leave our star 
  field like this we will simply be creating several really bright stars on top 
  of other stars. Let's add some variety to our star field by adjusting the Near 
  Stars layer so that we are not covering up other stars.</p>
  <ol start="47">
    <li>Make sure the <b>Near Stars</b> layer is the <b>active</b> layer - it 
    should be highlighted in gray</li>
    <li>Click <b>Edit</b> on the Menu Bar then point at <b>Transform</b> and 
    click <b>Flip Vertical</b>...<b><br>
    </b>
    <img border="0" src="10/1050.jpg" width="483" height="284"></li>
  </ol>
  <p>At first it may look like nothing happened because there are so few 
  stars on the Near Stars layer, but turn the visibility of the Near Stars layer 
  off and on and you will see the impact that it has. It is not making an enormous 
  change, but by having these slightly brighter stars we have given our space 
  scene some awesome depth.</p>
<p>You should have something similar to the image below...</p>
<p align="center">
    <img border="0" src="10/1021.jpg" width="500" height="500"></p>
<p align="left">You should notice that there are areas of dense stars and areas 
of fewer stars and that the areas of no stars are now more obvious. Feel free to remove more or less stars until you get something 
you like. Be careful though - once you remove stars it can be very difficult to 
get them back if you change your mind.</p>
<hr>
  <p>Now that our basic star field is ready to go, let's give it a sense of 
  uniqueness and coolness by adding a few really bright stars.</p>
  <ol start="49">
    <li><b>Lock</b> the Near Stars layer</li>
    <li>Insert a <b>new layer</b> and name it <b>Bright Stars</b> - make sure 
    this new layer is at the top of the layer stack and is selected</li>
    <li>Use the <b>Paint Bucket Tool </b>&nbsp;to <b>fill</b> the Bright Stars layer with <b>black</b></li>
    <li>Change the <b>blending mode</b> of the Bright Stars layer to <b>Linear Dodge (Add)</b></li>
    <li>Click the <b>Dodge Tool</b>...<br>
    <img border="0" src="10/1022.jpg" width="39" height="50"><br>
    The <span class="style2"><font color="#000000">Dodge Tool simply brightens up an area of an image</font></span>, so it is perfect for 
    creating bright spots that look like stars</li>
    <li>On the Dodge Tool Options Bar, change the <b>Range:</b> setting from 
    Midtones to <b>Shadows</b>...<br>
    <img border="0" src="10/1023.jpg" width="619" height="71"><br>
    Make sure Exposure is set to 50% (if <b>Protect Tones</b> is checked, turn it <b>off</b> by clicking the box)</li>
    <li>Change the Brush to <b>Soft Round</b> and set the size to <b>5 px</b>...<b><br>
    </b>
    <img border="0" src="10/1024.jpg" width="294" height="304"></li>
  </ol>
  Choose the area of your image you would like to add a bright star. Remember 
that in later steps you will be adding a bunch of other stuff like planets, 
asteroids, a comet, and more, so put your bright stars in places that you will 
not cover up later on.<ol start="56">

    <b>repeatedly</b> in one spot until the spot glows white (about 15 clicks seems to 
    work well) - be careful not to click and drag but instead click in the same 
    spot over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and 
    over and over and over and over and over and over and over...<br>
    <img border="0" src="10/1052.jpg" width="294" height="183"><br>
    Note that the image above is zoomed in to 500% to show the detail</li>
    <li><b>Press</b> the right bracket key <b>]</b> to increase the brush size 
    to something slightly larger, such as <b>9 px</b>, and then click some more in the same spot (don't 
    click as many times as you did in the last direction - try around 10 clicks 
    this time - so that what you are creating now is not as bright)...<br>
    <img border="0" src="10/1053.jpg" width="256" height="176"></li>
    <li><b>Increase</b> the brush size again (this time to around 15 px) and 
    click some more (around 5 clicks or so this time)...<br>
    <img border="0" src="10/1054.jpg" width="324" height="179"></li>
    <li><b>Increase</b> the brush size one more time (try from 20 to 25 px) and 
    click a few more times (only 3 or 4)...<br>
    <img border="0" src="10/1055.jpg" width="392" height="185"><br>
    Note that the image above really doesn't look all that great because the 
    image is actually being displayed in a webpage - your image in Photoshop 
    should look much nicer</li>
    <li><b>Determine</b> if you like your star at this point or if you want to 
    change it - you can increase the brush and click a few more times, or you 
    can grab the Eraser Tool and remove what you have and start over, but this 
    time vary the above brush sizes and click recommendations so that you have a 
    really nice looking, unique star</li>
  </ol>
  <p>You may be tempted to keep going and make a really, really big glowing 
  star, but don't. If you <font color="#800000"><b>make your star too large it 
  will seem unnatural</b></font>. Remember that we want realistic looking stars 
  and not huge white blobs.</p>
<p>One way to get unique bright stars is to choose a patterned brush such 
    as Spatter, Star (<i><b>NOT</b></i> the 5 pointed star), Starburst, or any other brush shape that gives you a nice 
    looking star (<b>do not</b> use Fuzzball, Flowing Stars, any of the leaf or grass 
    brushes, or any other brush that looks unnatural). You can even load new 
    sets of brushes by clicking the drop-down arrow on the Brush Preset Picker 
(left arrow below) 
    and then clicking the menu icon (right arrow below) and selecting the brush set you wish to use 
    at the bottom of the pop-up menu, as in the graphic below...</p>
<p align="center">
    <img border="0" src="10/1025.jpg" width="457" height="698"></p>
<p>Take some time to
    look at many of the brush sets to see if there are any brushes you would 
    like to use (again, stay away from the brushes shaped like grass or leaves 
    as well any that are square as there are no square stars - the only 
    exception to this is the Charcoal Large Smear brush which looks square, but 
    when you click repeatedly with it the square actually rotates to create an 
    interesting cloud formation that you can use to make a cool far off nebula 
    or the cloud around a bright star). Try to make your stars 
    unique and something other than a perfect circle (feel free to add some color to your bright stars if you wish, but 
    remember to keep it subtle)</p>
  <p>To help you out with making some really unique starts, have a look at the 
  image below...</p>
<p align="center">
    <img border="0" src="10/1026.jpg" width="403" height="485"></p>
<p align="left">The really cool stars in the middle column were created using 
the brushes in the left column, which can be found in the brush set indicated in 
the right column. Keep in mind two very important things as you create your 
bright stars:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p align="left">Customized stars will give your space scene a unique, 
  individual look that will make it stand out</li>
  <li>
  <p align="left">Your stars need to look <b>REALISTIC</b> - take a look at the 
  stars below...<br>
  <img border="0" src="10/1040.jpg" width="306" height="186"><br>
  Notice that only the bright star on the right looks like a real star in space - 
  the other stars may be cute or adorable but they are <i><b><font size="4">not</font></b></i> realistic</li>
</ul>
  <ol start="63">
    <li>
    <p align="left">Add in three or four bright stars (if you add too many you will limit 
    where you can put the planets and stuff we will be adding later) - <b>
    <font size="4">DO NOT</font></b> copy 
    the same star over and over (no two real stars look exactly alike) and <b><font size="4">DO NOT</font></b> use the same brush multiple 
    times - this looks unnatural; make each star unique - here is a close-up of my four stars...<br>
&nbsp;<img border="0" src="10/1027.jpg" width="200" height="47"><br>
    Notice that the stars are all unique, and that the third one from the left 
    has just a slight amount of yellow added to it (I know, they are awesome)</li>
  </ol>
  <p align="center"><b><font color="#800000">Let me say that one more time: <i>
  DO NOT</i> copy the same bright star multiple times</font></b></p>
  <p align="left"><b><font size="4">Be careful not to go crazy with how big you make your bright stars</font></b>. Take a 
  look at the image below...</p>
  <p align="center">
  <img border="0" src="10/1028.jpg" width="353" height="297"></p>
  <p>Notice that it looks like a fake star when you compare it to the stars below - 
  we are striving to make our image as realistic as possible</p>
  <p>Your star field should now be complete, and should look something like this (remember 
  that your stars will be in different places than mine)...</p>
  <p align="center">
    <img border="0" src="10/1029.jpg" width="499" height="500"></p>
  <p>Notice that my bright stars are not overly large and serve to add a nice 
  accent to my star field. Notice also that all four of them do NOT look the 
  same. When you have completed your bright stars, you will 
  need to reset the brush set back to the Default set.</p>
  <ol start="64">
    <li>Click on the Brush Preset Picker and open the Brush Set menu and select
    <b>Reset Brushes</b>...<br>
    <img border="0" src="10/1041.jpg" width="303" height="393"></li>
    <li>Photoshop will ask if you wish to load the default brushes...<br>
    <img border="0" src="10/1042.jpg" width="391" height="126"><br>
    Click <b>OK</b></li>
</ol>
  <p>Before we continue creating our amazing space panorama, we need to put all of 
  the star field layers into one layer group so that we can work with them all 
  at the same time to do such things as turn off their visibility or rearrange 
  them in the layer stack.</p>
  <ol start="66">
    <li>
  <b>Select</b> all of the layers by clicking the top layer (Bright Stars) then 
  pressing and holding <b>Shift</b> and clicking the bottom layer (Layer 1)...<br>
    <img border="0" src="10/1044.jpg" width="240" height="244"></li>
    <li>
  <b>Click  </b>the <span class="style2"><b><font color="#000000">Create a new group</font></b><font color="#000000"> icon to create a group containing all of the layers</font></span> (the red arrow below)...<br>
    <img border="0" src="10/1030.jpg" width="240" height="72"></li>
    <li>
  The layers will be inserted into a group called <b>Group 1</b>...<br>
    <img border="0" src="10/1031.jpg" width="241" height="81"><br>
  Note that you can expand the group and view the 
  layers in it at any time by clicking the arrow head between the eye and the 
  folder icon...<br>
    <img border="0" src="10/1056.jpg" width="241" height="63"></li>
    <li>
  <b>Double-click</b> the name <b>Group 1</b> and rename it <b>Star Field</b>...<b><br>
  </b>
    <img border="0" src="10/1032.jpg" width="242" height="75"></li>
    <li>
  <b>Lock</b> the Star Field layer group so you do not accidentally mess up any of the 
  layers...<br>
    <img border="0" src="10/1033.jpg" width="242" height="75"></li>
  </ol>
  <p>In the next Step we will give our space scene some color by adding in a 
  nice nebula.</p>
