<img src="03/301.jpg" hspace="2" align="right" border="1" width="185" height="406">Before 
we go any further, let's take a quick second to learn a little about how 
computers think about color.</p>
<p>
While there are hundreds of millions of different colors in nature, the human 
eye can only distinguish a few million (anywhere between 3 and 10 million 
depending on the person) because our eyes compress visible light into three 
primary colors: red, green, and blue. So, when we designed movie projectors, televisions, computers, 
monitors, etc. we only worried about reproducing the colors we can see, and not 
about reproducing colors in their true nature.</p>
<p>There are two basic ways of reproducing color:</p>
<ol type="A">
  <li>The first is used when a light source, such as a computer monitor or TV, 
  is projecting the color. Photoshop calls this the <span class="style1"><b>
  <font color="#000000">RGB</font></b><font color="#000000"> color system because it 
  uses various shades of Red, Green, and Blue</font></span> to make every other color. When 
  all three are present, as in the top graphic to the right, we get white. When none 
  of the three are present, we get black. This color system also goes by the 
  name of <b>Additive Colors</b>, as the more color you put in the brighter the resulting color is.</li>
  <li>The second is used by printers, inks, and paint and is known as <strong>CMYK</strong>. We start with a surface, like a sheet of paper or 
  the side of a house, and 
  as we add various colors onto it the result will get darker and darker. Here, our 
  primary colors are Cyan 
(the absence of red), magenta (the absence of green), and yellow (the absence of blue). 
  These three mixed together will create a very dark color, but not always true 
  black, so there is also a separate black color as well. Yes, the &quot;K&quot; stands for black, because &quot;B&quot; already stands for blue. If you use this 
method, Photoshop will be thinking of your colors in these four channels, but of course it will 
still be translating them to RGB to be displayed on your monitor. This color system also goes by the name of 
  <span class="style1"><b><font color="#000000">Subtractive Colors</font></b><font color="#000000">, as the more color you put in the darker the resulting 
  color</font></span> is (think about pouring all different colors in a paint can, what 
  happens as you add more color?).</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Keep in mind that RGB color is best for viewing graphics on a computer monitor while CMYK color 
is best for creating printed graphics.</b></p>
<p>Okay, back to our picture. We want to change the color of the picture so that 
it has a blue tint so that when 
we begin creating the line work (which we will do in black) we will not be confused by the 
colors in the picture. 
We're going to work in RGB color, so the first thing to do is to make sure it is 
selected.</p>
<ol>
  <li>
  <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">If your <b>
  Face</b> image 
  is not open, open it in Photoshop now; this is the image I will be using in this 
  tutorial...<br>
<img src="03/302.jpg" hspace="0" width="224" height="279"></li>
  <li>
  <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Click <b>Image</b> on the Menu 
  Bar...<br>
<img src="03/313.jpg" hspace="0" width="415" height="29"></li>
  <li>
  <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Point at <b>Mode</b>...<b><br>
  </b>
<img src="03/314.jpg" hspace="0" width="367" height="88"></li>
  <li>
  <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Make sure that <b>RGB Color </b>
  is selected - there should be a checkmark next to RGB Color like the graphic 
  below...<br>
<img src="03/315.jpg" hspace="0" width="432" height="153"><br>
  If there is no checkmark, click on RGB Color to select 
  it - if you already have a checkmark, you can click back on the word Image on the Menu 
  Bar to remove the menu</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that &quot;Grayscale&quot; and &quot;CMYK Color&quot; are also in this submenu, as well as other less common 
methods of color.</p>
<p>
Now let's take a look at working with individual colors within RGB. We first 
need to get up the Levels editor.</p>
<ol start="5">
  <li>Click <b>Image</b> on the Menu Bar</li>
  <li>Point at <b>Adjustments </b>then<b> </b>click <b>Levels...</b><br>
<img src="03/304.jpg" hspace="0" width="478" height="125"><br>
  The <b>Levels</b> editor window (pictured below) opens...<br>
<img src="03/305.jpg" hspace="0" width="425" height="379"></li>
</ol>
<p>Before we make any changes, let's look at how the Levels 
editor functions. The <b>Channel</b> selector 
at the top tells whether you are working with red, green, blue, or all of them 
at once (named 
RGB, the default selection). Photoshop keeps 
separate level settings for each of these four channels. The histogram 
  (that black mountain looking thing under Input Levels:<span class="style1"><font color="#000000">) 
tells you how common shades of the selected channel are, ranging from 0 (dark) 
on the left, to 255 (bright) on the right</font></span>. Since we are working with a full-color photograph, the graph should show 
a large amount of black, as in the screenshot above (since you are working with 
a different image your graph will not look exactly like mine). If our image had only a few 
colors, or was black and white, we would see a much smaller amount of black in 
the graph.</p>
<p>The main controls in this panel are the three arrows under the graph (see 
Image 1 below) which control the Input Level, 
and the two arrows under the gradient below them (see Image 2 below) which 
control the Output Levels. The input arrows define where black, white, and 50% 
gray are on the scale. The output arrows define how white the brightest white can be, and how dark the darkest 
dark can be.</p>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" width="100%" id="AutoNumber3">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%" align="center">
    <img border="0" src="03/306.jpg" width="298" height="54"><br>
    Image 1</td>
    <td width="50%" align="center">  
    <img border="0" src="03/307.jpg" width="301" height="51"><br>
    Image 2</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>If you have changed the levels in a way (and you should NOT have, but if you did...), hit 
&quot;Cancel&quot; and then get the levels editor back up again. We're going to use the levels editor to turn 
the picture a light blue. We do this because the dark colored picture can obscure some of 
the details of the black ink that we will be drawing with, and dark smudges cannot slip by as easy if they don't blend in with 
the picture color.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Here is how to make yourself blue.</p>
<ol start="7">
  <li>Click the dropdown arrow next to <b>Channel</b> and 
  click <b>Blue</b>...<br>
    <img border="0" src="03/308.jpg" width="295" height="149"><br>
  Notice when you select Blue that the histogram 
  changes</li>
  <li>We want to make it so that blue is all light, so grab the <b>dark output 
  arrow</b> (this is the one under the gradient bar all the way to the left under the black section)...<br>
    <img border="0" src="03/309.jpg" width="320" height="162"><br>
  and drag it as far to the right as it will go - when you drag it all the way to 
  the right, it should disappear behind the white arrow...<br>
    <img border="0" src="03/310.jpg" width="293" height="105"><br>
  This is ok - we want this at this point - and you should now be blue...<br>
    <img border="0" src="03/316.jpg" width="150" height="185"></li>
</ol>
<p>You should now be blue! You can now fine-tune your image to get a shade of 
blue you are comfortable working with.</p>
<ol start="9">
  <li>Change the <b>Channel</b> from <b>Blue</b> to <b>Green</b>...<b><br>
  </b>
    <img border="0" src="03/312.jpg" width="291" height="254"><br>
  Notice that the dark output arrow we were working 
  with a moment ago has now returned to the left side (bottom arrow above) - this is because we are 
  no longer working with blue but are now working 
  with green</li>
  <li>Grab the <b>dark output arrow</b> (the same one we dragged around when 
  working with blue) and drag it to the right until you have a nice shade of 
  blue that allows you to see all the image details...<br>
<img src="03/311.jpg" border="1" width="247" height="286"><br>
  You can drag to any amount you like, but <b>90</b> is usually 
  an amount that works great...<br>
<img src="03/317.jpg" border="1" width="293" height="107"></li>
  <li>Click <b>OK</b></li>
</ol>
<p align="center"><font size="5"><b><i>YOU</i></b></font><i><b><font size="5"> SHOULD BE  </font>
<font color="#0000FF" size="5">BLUE</font><font size="5"> AND <u>NOT</u> </font>
<font color="#800080" size="5">PURPLE</font><font size="5"> OR </font>
<br><font color="#008080" size="5">GREEN</font><font size="5"> OR </font>
<font color="#00FFFF" size="5">LIGHT BLUE</font><font size="5"> or any other color!</font></b></i></p>
<p>It should look something like the image above - if your image is purplish or 
greenish or light bluish then close your image without saving and reopen it and 
start over and be sure you are working with the correct channel when you make your 
changes.</p>
<p>I should probably point out that there are other ways, even easier ways, to 
turn the picture blue, but it will help a lot if you familiarize yourself with 
the Levels editor, which can be very useful at completing other tasks, such as 
brightening a final picture that is too dark. Keep in mind that your shade of 
blue does not have to match mine (in fact, when doing this on your own at some 
future time you can actually make the image any color other than black that you 
like), you just want the image a color other than black so that you can see the 
lines when you begin drawing them in.</p>
<p>Let's save our image at this point so we can begin creating the lines in the 
next step.</p>
