  <p>For our first planet, we will cheat a little and create our fictitious 
  world from an existing satellite photo. I have a selection of photos for you 
  to choose from so you don't have to worry about finding your own image.</p>
  <p>Before we get started, keep the following in mind:</p>
  <p align="center"><b><font size="4">YOUR PLANET SHOULD REMAIN 
  SELECTED FROM DIRECTION 13 THRU DIRECTION 64. IF YOU HAPPEN TO DESELECT YOUR 
  PLANET, YOU CAN RESELECT IT BY PRESSING AND HOLDING THE Ctrl KEY AND CLICKING

  <p>The first thing to do is select the image you want to use.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Open your <b>Space</b> file in Photoshop<li>Click <b>
    File</b> then click <b>Open...</b><br>
    <img border="0" src="13/1301.jpg" width="325" height="95" align="middle"><li>
    <b>Go</b> to the folder on the server that contains the planet images - your

    <img border="0" src="13/1302.jpg" width="391" height="167" align="middle"><br>
    and choose <b>Extra large icons</b>...<br>
    <img border="0" src="13/1303.jpg" width="193" height="171" align="middle"><br>
    This will give you a good look at all 
    of your image choices</li>
  </ol>
  <p>There are 125 satellite images for you to choose 
    from and each will create a different, unique planet, so choose wisely.</p>

</div>
  <p>Take a few minutes and look through the images and find something that you 
  really like. Let me warn you that many students will simply use the first (or 
  last) image for no other reason than the fact that it is the first (or last) 
  on the list. I would advise against this. You want to create a unique space 
  scene, and if your planet looks identical to 20 other student's planets then 
  your scene will not look very unique. If you want to use the first (or last) 
  image, make sure you are using it because you really like it and not because 
	you are too lazy to look through the images.</p>
  <ol start="5">
    <li>Click the <b>Elliptical Marquee Tool</b></li>
    <li>Press and hold the <b>Shift</b> key so you 
    get a perfect circle, then <b>click and drag</b> to create a circular 
    selection on an area of the image that you like and want to turn into your 
    planet - keep in mind that the larger the selection the better your 
    resulting planet 
    will be as this will 
    give your planet more detail in the end; the example we will use in this 
    tutorial 
    is shown below...<br>
    <img border="0" src="13/1304.jpg" width="400" height="415" align="middle"><br>
    Note that the elliptical marquee selection is indicated by the red arrow 
    above</li>
    <li>Press <b>Ctrl+C</b> to copy the selection</li>
    <li>Click <b>Window</b> on the Menu Bar and at the very bottom of the pop-up menu, 
    select <b>Space.psd</b>...<br>
    <img border="0" src="13/1305.jpg" width="201" height="80" align="middle"><br>
    to return to your Space file</li>
    <li>Press <b>Ctrl+V</b> to paste the planet - notice that Photoshop 
    places the image on a new layer...<br>
    <img border="0" src="13/1333.jpg" width="241" height="235" align="middle"></li>
    <li><b>Return </b>to the satellite image and close the file - when it asks if 
    you would like to save the changes click <b>No</b></li>
    <li>Return to your space scene image and rename the new layer <b>Planet</b></li>
    <li>You should now have something like this...<br>
    <img border="0" src="13/1306.jpg" width="597" height="276" align="middle"></li>
    <li>Once again we want to turn our flat image into an image that looks round 
    - press and hold the <b>Ctrl</b> key on the keyboard and click on the layer's thumbnail image 
    - this will select all of the non-transparent pixels on the layer (in this 
    case, it will select the planet)...<br>
    <img border="0" src="13/1307.jpg" width="245" height="75" align="middle"></li>
    <li>Click <b>Filter</b> then point at <b>Distort</b> and click <b>Spherize</b></li>
    <li>Set the Amount to <b>100%</b> and click <b>OK</b></li>
  </ol>
  <p>If your planet just suddenly doubled in size or changed into some strange oval 
  or other non-round 
  shape then you did not have the planet selected when you applied the Spherize 
  filter. Undo the Spherize and go back to direction <b>13</b> and <b>do it right</b>.</p>
  <ol start="16">
    <li>Take a look at your planet and determine if you are happy with how 
    spherical it looks; if not, repeat the Spherize, but turn down the Amount 
    (most of you will want to the second Spherize to be applied with the Amount set to 50%)...<br>
    <img border="0" src="13/1308.jpg" width="323" height="308" align="middle"><br>
    When you are happy with how spherical your planet looks, move on to the next 
    direction</li>
    <li><b>Duplicate</b> the Planet layer and rename the duplicate layer <b>Emboss</b>...<br>
    <img border="0" src="13/1334.jpg" width="241" height="160" align="middle"></li>
    <li><b>Lock </b>the Planet layer</li>
    <li><b>Select</b> the new Emboss layer (it should be highlighted in gray as 
    in the image above) and click <b>Filter</b> then point at <b>Stylize</b> and click <b>Emboss</b> (<span class="style1"><font color="#000000">this filter makes your image seem as though it has texture</font></span> 
    [or raised areas], or in this case that your planet has mountains and valleys)...<br>
    <img border="0" src="13/1335.jpg" width="399" height="428" align="middle"></li>
    <li><b>Adjust</b> the setting so they resemble those below...<br>
    <img border="0" src="13/1309.jpg" width="332" height="441" align="middle"><br>
    You do not have to use the exact same settings - adjust them to whatever you 
    like, but be careful that the degree of emboss you have resembles the degree 
    in the above image, any more or less and your image will not turn out 
    correctly (Angle can be pretty much anything you like, but Height should be 
    kept from 3-5 and Amount should range from 50-120)</li>
    <li>Click <b>OK</b></li>
    <li>Change the <b>blending mode</b> (remember that the blending mode is on 
    the Layers panel just to the left of Opacity) of the <b>Emboss</b> layer to one of the 
    following...<br>
    <img border="0" src="13/1310.jpg" width="141" height="97" align="middle"><br>
    Which you choose is up to you, so test each and choose one that causes your 
    land to appear as though it actually has height and texture; I'm going to 
    use <b>Vivid Light</b>...<br>
    <img border="0" src="13/1311.jpg" width="291" height="284" align="middle"><br>
    Notice that the mountains now have dimension to them and the coast has more 
    contour - the effect is subtle, but this is what we are going for here so 
    that when we 
    can add some clouds in the next direction our image will have some depth to 
    it</li>
    <li><b>Lock</b> the Emboss layer</li>
    <li><b>Insert</b> a new layer and name it <b>Clouds1</b>...<b><br>
    </b>
    <img border="0" src="13/1336.jpg" width="240" height="128" align="middle"></li>
    <li>Make sure the <b>Clouds1</b> layer is selected</li>
    <li>Press <b>D</b> on the keyboard</li>
    <li> <b>Fill</b> the <b>CIRCULAR</b> selection with black (you should still 
    have the round shape of the planet selected)</li>
    <li>Click <b>Filter</b> then point at <b>Render</b> and click <b>Clouds</b></li>
    <li>Click <b>Filter</b> then point at <b>Distort</b> and click <b>Spherize</b></li>
    <li>Make the Amount <b>100%</b></li>
    <li>Click <b>OK</b></li>
    <li>Change the <b>blending mode</b> of the <b>Clouds1</b> layer to <b>Hard Light 
    - </b>you should now have a gentle covering of clouds...<br>
    <img border="0" src="13/1312.jpg" width="300" height="283" align="middle"></li>
    <li><b>Lock</b> the Clouds1 layer</li>
    <li><b>Insert</b> a new layer at the top of the layer stack and name it <b>Clouds2</b></li>
    <li>Press <b>D</b> then <b>Fill</b> the <b>CIRCULAR</b> selection with black</li>
    <li>Click <b>Filter</b> then point at <b>Render</b> and click <b>Clouds</b></li>
    <li>Click <b>Filter</b> then point at <b>Render</b> and click <b>Difference 
    Clouds</b></li>
    <li>Press <b>Ctrl+Alt+F</b> several times until you have a cloud pattern you like - 
    it should have large amounts of dark areas in it</li>
    <li>Click <b>Filter</b> then point at <b>Distort</b> and click <b>Spherize</b></li>
    <li>Make the Amount <b>100%</b></li>
    <li>Click <b>OK</b></li>
    <li>Change the <b>blending mode</b> of the Clouds2 layer to <b>Screen</b> 
    (also give Linear Dodge (Add) and Hard Light a try and see which of the 
    three you 
    like best) - you should now have a covering of both light and dark clouds...<br>
    <img border="0" src="13/1313.jpg" width="285" height="283" align="middle"></li>
    <li><b>Lock</b> the Clouds2 layer</li>
  </ol>
  Now let's give our planet a nice shadow so that it looks like our sun is only 
shining on one side of the planet.<ol start="44">
    <li> <b>Insert</b> a new layer at the top of the layer stack and name it
    <b>Shadow</b> (leave it selected!)</li>
    <li><b>Fill</b> the round selection with <b>black</b></li>
    <li>Select the <b>Eraser Tool</b></li>
    <li>Set the Brush to <b>Soft Round  </b> and adjust the Size to <b>500</b>...<br>
    <img border="0" src="13/1314.jpg" width="294" height="279" align="middle"><br>
    You can use a larger or smaller brush if you wish depending on the size of 
    your planet</li>
    <li>Position your cursor over your planet similar to the image below...<br>
    <img border="0" src="13/1337.jpg" width="349" height="318" align="middle"><br>
    Remember that you want to erase the black from the side of your planet 
    closest to your sun and leave the other side in shadow</li>
    <li>Click the mouse button several times to <b>Erase</b> the portion of the Shadow layer so that the planet shows 
    through on the side <b>toward</b> the sun (be careful not to erase too much 
    of the shadow) - you should now have something similar to the image below...<br>
    <img border="0" src="13/1315.jpg" width="280" height="282" align="middle"><br>
    Not a bad looking planet if you ask me :-)</li>
    <li><b>Lock</b> the Shadow layer</li>
  </ol>
  <p>To add a little more realism to our planet, let's put a soft glow around 
  the edge to simulate the glow seen when sunlight reflects off the atmosphere.</p>
<ol start="51">
    <li> <b>Insert</b> a new layer at the top of the layer stack and rename it
    <b>Atmosphere</b></li>
    <li><b>Fill</b> the round selection with <b>black</b></li>
    <li>Change the <b>blending mode</b> of the Atmosphere layer to <b>Screen</b>...<br>
    <img border="0" src="13/1316.jpg" width="241" height="138" align="middle"></li>
    <li><b>Double-click</b> the Atmosphere layer to open the <b>Layer Style</b> window</li>
    <li>Click the <b>Outer Glow</b> checkbox and set all of the options to match the 
    following image...<br>
    <img border="0" src="13/1317.jpg" width="800" height="484" align="middle"></li>
    <li>Click the <b>Inner Glow</b> checkbox and set all of the options to match the 
    following image...<br>
    <img border="0" src="13/1318.jpg" width="800" height="484" align="middle"></li>
    <li>Click <b>OK</b> - you should now have an image and layers similar to the image 
    below...<br>
    <img border="0" src="13/1319.jpg" width="615" height="376" align="middle"></li>
  </ol>
  <p>We now need to get rid of the glow on the shadow side of the planet. 
  Unfortunately, we can't just grab the Eraser Tool and erase the glow because 
  it is not actually on the Atmosphere (remember that it is actually an effect 
  being applied to the black circle that is actually on the Atmosphere layer). 
  We need to convert the Atmosphere layer from a layer with an effect applied to 
  it to a regular layer. To do this, we will merge the Atmosphere layer with a 
  regular blank layer.</p>
<ol start="58">
    <li><b>Insert</b> a new layer (just leave it named whatever Photoshop names 
    it) and make sure it is at the <b>top</b> of the layer 
    stack</li>
    <li><b>Select</b> both the <b>new layer</b> you just created and the <b>Atmosphere</b> 
    layer (select the new layer then press and hold Shift as you click the 
    Atmosphere layer)</li>
    <li>Press <span class="style1"><b><font color="#000000">Ctrl+E</font></b><font color="#000000"> to have Photoshop merge the two layers 
    - don't freak out that it is no longer named Atmosphere, remember that when 
    you merge layers that Photoshop gives the newly merged layer the name of 
    whatever layer was on top when you merged them.</font></span></li>
    <li><b>Rename</b> the newly merged layers back to <b>Atmosphere</b> - your planet 
    should now look similar to the image below...<br>
    <img border="0" src="13/1320.jpg" width="241" height="239" align="middle"><br>
    The selection is filled with black again because the blending mode of the new 
    Atmosphere layer is no longer Screen</li>
    <li>Change the <b>blending mode</b> of the Atmosphere layer to <b>Screen</b></li>
    <li>Deselect your circle by pressing <b>Ctrl+D</b></li>
    <li><b>Move</b> the <b>Shadow</b> layer above the <b>Atmosphere</b> layer 
    (in other words, put Shadow at the top of the layer stack) - your planet 
    should now look similar to this...<br>
    <img border="0" src="13/1321.jpg" width="170" height="168" align="middle"></li>
  </ol>
  <p>Our Atmosphere layer is now just a regular, every day layer. Let's erase 
  the glow from the shadow side.</p>
  <ol start="65">
    <li>Click the <b>Eraser Tool</b></li>
    <li>Make the <b>Atmosphere</b> layer the active layer (Atmosphere and NOT 
    Shadow)</li>
    <li>Use the same settings for the Eraser that you used for the Brush Tool in <b>direction 47</b> and erase 
    the glowing atmosphere from the shaded side of the planet - you should now have a planet similar to the one below...<br>
    <img border="0" src="13/1322.jpg" width="328" height="307" align="middle"></li>
  </ol>
  <p>Our planet now has a nice atmospheric glow, but there is a problem. Notice 
  the thin,  
    white border around the shadow side of my planet in the above image. The border of your planet 
  may be as visible as the border around my planet above, or it may be  
  harder to see, but it is there (this border exists because all of the layers we 
  have added above our initial Planet layer are just a tiny bit smaller than our planet). 
  To fix this little issue we will simply increase the size of our clouds, 
  atmosphere, and shadow layers a small amount.</p>
  <ol start="68">
    <li>Make the <b>Shadow</b> layer the active layer (this should be the top layer in 
    your layer stack) and press and hold the <b>Shift</b> key then click the <b>Clouds1</b> 
    layer - this should select the top four layers of your layer stack...<br>
    <img border="0" src="13/1323.jpg" width="241" height="204" align="middle"></li>
    <li>Click the <b>Lock all</b> icon to unlock all of the selected layers...<br>
    <img border="0" src="13/1338.jpg" width="242" height="212" align="middle"></li>
    <li>Click <b>Edit</b> on the Menu Bar and point at <b>Transform</b> then click 
    <b>Scale</b>...<br>
    <img border="0" src="13/1324.jpg" width="483" height="109" align="middle"><br>
    to activate the scale resize handles around the image...<br>
    <img border="0" src="13/1325.jpg" width="179" height="179" align="middle"></li>
    <li>On the Scale options bar, click the <b>Maintain Aspect Ratio</b> button...<br>
    <img border="0" src="13/1326.jpg" width="690" height="51" align="middle"><br>
    this will cause Photoshop to change the height of our selection by the same 
    amount that we are about to change the width</li>
    <li>Double-click in the <b>Set Horizontal Scale</b> box...<br>
    <img border="0" src="13/1327.jpg" width="690" height="51" align="middle"></li>
    <li>Type <b>101</b>...<br>
    <img border="0" src="13/1328.jpg" width="690" height="51" align="middle"></li>
    <li>Press <b>Enter</b> twice to apply the rescale - the thin, white border should now be 
    gone...<br>
    <img border="0" src="13/1329.jpg" width="297" height="291" align="middle"></li>
  </ol>
  <p>At this point, let's take a quick second and make sure that we are happy 
  with our planet. Depending on how the cloud filter applied clouds to your 
  planet, your cloud cover is either perfect or a little too thick. Let's run a 
  quick test to see if we need to adjust our cloud layers.</p>
  <ol start="75">
    <li>Turn the <b>Opacity</b> of your <b>Cloud1</b> and <b>Cloud2</b> layers 
    down to <b>50%</b></li>
  </ol>
  <p>Take a look at the image below...</p>
  <p align="center">
    <img border="0" src="13/1339.jpg" width="525" height="250" align="middle"></p>
  <p>Notice that the difference between 100% Opacity and 50% Opacity on my 
  planet is not huge (note that in the 50% planet you can see additional 
  mountains near the top of the planet and the cloud cover over the ocean is 
  diminished). The lower the Opacity on the cloud layers the more visible your 
  surface features will be. I'm not going to tell you what Opacity setting to 
  use on your planet - you get to decide that for yourself.</p>
  <ol start="76">
    <li>Determine what level of cloud Opacity you want for your planet and set 
    your Opacity - note that you can set any level of Opacity you wish (you 
    could even set the two layers to different Opacity, so if you think Cloud1 
    should be set to 60% and Cloud2 should be set to 80%, then go for it), just 
    DO NOT fall below <b>50%</b> Opacity for each level</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Now that our planet is complete, let's move all of our planet layers into a 
  layer group so we can adjust its size and reposition it in our scene.</p>
  <ol start="77">
    <li>Make sure all 6 layers that make up your planet are <b>unlocked</b></li>
    <li><b>Select</b> all six of the layers that make up your planet...<br>
    <img border="0" src="13/1330.jpg" width="239" height="282" align="middle"></li>
    <li>Click 
    the <b>Create a new group</b> icon - this should place all of your layers 
    into a layer group</li>
    <li><b>Rename</b> the new layer group <b>Planet1</b>...<br>
    <img border="0" src="13/1331.jpg" width="241" height="115" align="middle"></li>
    <li>Turn on the visibility of all of your layer groups</li>
    <li>Click <b>Edit</b> then point at <b>Transform</b> and click <b>Scale</b> 
    and resize your planet to something more in scale with your sun (remember to 
    hold the <b>Shift</b> key and use one of the planet's corner resize handles 
    to resize your planet so it does not turn out egg shaped)</li>
    <li><b>Lock</b> the Planet1 layer group</li>
  </ol>
  With all of your layer groups and layers turned on, you should now have a space 
    scene similar to the one below...<p align="center">

  <p>The really great part about this process for building a planet is that you 
  do not have to start with a satellite photo. You can use a hand-drawn image, a 
  photograph of any unique object, or even a unique pattern or brush stroke to 
  make a planet with a distinct surface.</p>
  <p>For our second planet, we are going to start from scratch and create a Saturn-like world complete 
  with rings.</p>
