<font face="Times New Roman"><p>This first step is an introduction to 
the basics of Photoshop. It will cover such basic items as Photoshop's interface, 
menu, file type, and some other basic info. If you are familiar with Photoshop 
then some of this information will be a review, but if you have never used 
Photoshop then this information will be very important to helping you become 
familiar with the software.</p>
<p>
<font face="Times New Roman">The 20 steps of this tutorial will walk you through creating everything you 
need to have a wonderful project. As you go through these tutorials, keep

<hr>
<p>Photoshop is an advanced image editing program that was originally developed 
as a raster image editor in 1988 by Thomas and John Knoll. The program 
was originally distributed by scanner manufacturer <i>Barneyscan</i> when customers 
purchased a new scanner. The software was later purchased by Adobe and Photoshop 
1.0 was released in 1990. Today, Photoshop is the world's premiere image editing 
software.</p>
<p>While Photoshop was originally designed to work with raster images, it can 
also work with vector images (though it does have some limitations).</p>
<ul>
  <li> Raster images are composed 
of groups of 
individual pixels and allow each pixel to be a separate color.</li>
  <li> 
Vector images 
are created through a system of points and lines connected using mathematical 
relationships.</li>
</ul>

<p>The images above are shown larger than their normal size to emphasize that 
the larger you make a raster image the more distorted it will become while a 
vector image will remain clean and pretty no matter how big or small you make it.</p>
<hr>
<p>Let's jump in now and examine the Photoshop interface. </p>
<ol>















<font face="Times New Roman">
  <li>Open <b>Photoshop</b> (click the Start button and locate Adobe Photoshop CC 
  2017 in the program list and click it)</li>
</font>
</ol>
<p>Below is a screenshot of what you will likely see...</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="01/101.jpg" width="1058" height="423"></p>
<p>This is called the Start workspace and allows you to select from a list of 
recent files you have worked with (and since you have no recent files your list 
will likely be empty, but don't worry if it's not) or to begin working with a 
new file. Since we are going to be working with the photograph we just took, 
let's select the Open option.</p>
<ol start="2">
  <li>Click the Open button...<br>
  <img border="0" src="01/102.jpg" width="299" height="256"><br>
  The Open window opens...<br>
  <img border="0" src="01/130.jpg" width="779" height="539"></li>
  <li>Go to the folder containing the class pictures</font><font face="Times New Roman"> 
  - your teacher will tell you where this is located</li>
</font>
<font face="times new roman">
  <li>Locate your headshot picture and double-click it, which will open your 
  picture in Photoshop...<br>
  <img border="0" src="01/131.jpg" width="528" height="391"></li>
</ol>
<p>Let's take a few minutes and have a look around Photoshop and get familiar 
with the interface. Keep in mind that the layout you see above may not match 
what you see on your screen because you can customize Photoshop's 
display (don't worry, we will reset the display so that we all see the same 
thing in a moment). The dark interface is the default setting for Photoshop, a look that 
Adobe's developers claim helps to make using the software a more immersive 
experience and allows users to focus on the image and not on the interface 
itself. Unfortunately, using such strong colors in the interface can actually 
trick your eyes into thinking the image you are editing is brighter or darker 
than it really is. Let's take a second to edit the display and change the 
hard-to-look-at-black background to a nice light gray color.</p>
<ol start="5">
  <li>Click <b>Edit</b>...<br>
  <img border="0" src="01/132.jpg" width="301" height="124"></li>
  <li>At the bottom of the Edit menu list, point at <b>Preferences</b></li>
  <li>On the pop-out menu click <b>Interface</b>...<br>
  <img border="0" src="01/133.jpg" width="558" height="443"><br>
  Note that you may have to click the arrow at the bottom of the menu list...<br>
  <img border="0" src="01/134.jpg" width="334" height="95"><br>
  several times to see the Preferences option</li>
  <li>In the Preferences window, click the lightest available color scheme...<br>
  <img border="0" src="01/135.jpg" width="564" height="138"></li>
  <li>Click <b>OK</b> and notice that Photoshop is now a much nicer and 
  easier-on-the-eyes gray color</li>
</ol>
</font><font face="times new roman">
<p>Photoshop places the tools for working with images in five main sections:</p>
<ol type="I">
  <li>Menu bar</li>
  <li>















<font face="Times New Roman">Tools panel</font></li>
  <li>Options bar</li>
  <li>Panels</li>
  <li>Status bar</li>
</ol>
<p>These five sections along with the Document window 
(where you actually see and manipulate your image) make up the Photoshop 
interface. Let's take a quick look at each section.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Application bar</b></p>
<p>Across the very top of screen is the <b>Application</b> <b>bar</b> (includes File, 
Edit, Image, etc. - also known as the Menu bar). This bar is common to most Windows and Mac based programs and 
operates the same in all of them. Near the end of the menu bar is the <b>Window</b> 
button...</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="01/107.jpg" width="489" height="29"></p>
<p>When you click it, a drop-down menu appears that allows you to choose which 
tool panels you want to show in your workspace. If you mess up your workspace 
(like close your Layers or History panel or open up every single panel so you 
have zero workspace), you can use this to reset the display back to the basic settings. 
Let's do this now so that we are certain everyone has the same display.</p>
<ol start="10">
  <li>Click <b>Window</b> and in the menu that pops up point at <b>Workspace</b> 
  and in the menu that pops up click <b>Reset Essentials</b>...<br>
<img border="0" src="01/136.jpg" width="420" height="247"></li>
</ol>
<p>While the Application bar is common to computer programs, Photoshop has four 
unique areas we need to discuss: Tools panel, Options, bar, Panel section, and 
Status bar. Let's look at each one in more depth.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Tools panel</b></p>
<p>The Tools panel should be visible to you on the left side of your screen. Take a look at the tools 
Photoshop offers. Remember that any tool that has a little arrow to its lower right 
has more than one mode. You can either right-click a button or click it and 
hover for a second to see all of its modes.</p>
<p>
Here's a screenshot of  Photoshop's Tools panel (yours is probably one column 
- this is fine, I just put the image in two columns to made it fit easier on the 
page)...</p>
<p>
<img border="0" src="01/108.jpg" align="left" width="476" height="439">Many of the more useful tools are expanded to show all their varieties, 
and labels are on some other useful parts. It's a good idea to leave the tools 
with multiple varieties set to the ones you see selected here, since we'll be using 
the <b>Brush</b> and <b>Paint Bucket</b> tools later.</p>
<p>The top batch of tools has to do with selection and basic editing. The <b>Marquee</b> tools can select 
areas in the shape of rectangles, circles, and lines. Any selected area will be outlined with a black and white pattern 
that some people like to call &quot;Marching Ants.&quot; Any actions you do will be confined to that area. The 
selection can be cancelled by clicking <b>Select</b> on the Menu bar and choosing <span class="style1"><b>
<font color="#000000">Deselect</font></b><font color="#000000">, 
or pressing </font> <b><font color="#000000">Ctrl+D</font></b></span> on the keyboard (this is a useful shortcut -
<span class="style2"> <font color="#000000">remember it!</font></span>). 
Other important tools in this batch are <b>Move</b> (allows you to 
drag around a selected area), <b>Lasso</b> (for drawing your own selected areas),  
<span class="style1"><b><font color="#000000">Magic Wand</font></b><font color="#000000"> (for 
selecting an area of similar colors)</font></span>, and <b>Crop</b> (to remove unwanted 
portions of your image). The 
<b>Eyedropper</b> 
tool is also good to know, since you can use it to pick colors to work with from an existing 
picture.</p>
<p>The next batch is the freehand tools. The most important ones are the <b>Brush</b> tool (which draws 
with color), and the <b>Pencil</b> tool (for coloring solid pixels). The <b>Eraser</b> tool works like the brush 
tool, except that it turns things transparent instead of drawing. The <b>Paint Bucket</b> tool is good for 
filling areas with a color or pattern.</p>
<p>Next, we have some <span class="style1"><font color="#000000">vector tools. There are several important buttons in this section, such as 
    <b>Text</b>, <b>Pen</b>, and </font> <b><font color="#000000">Direct Selection</font></b></span>. Many of these tools work by storing data about lines instead of 
data about pixels. This means we can resize these items without having to worry about the blurring 
that often happens when graphics are resized. We'll give you a break and say don't worry about these 
too much right now.</p>
<p>Under these are some miscellaneous tools. The <b>Hand</b> and the <b>Zoom</b> 
tools are very important, 
because they can be used to pan and zoom your view of the image you're working on. It's good to know 
the keyboard shortcuts for these: <span class="style1"><b><font color="#000000">Ctrl+Plus key</font></b><font color="#000000"> zooms in and <b>Ctrl+Minus 
key</b> zooms out</font></span>, and clicking and dragging the mouse while the space 
bar is pressed will pan the picture.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="01/109.jpg" align="left" width="39" height="58">Near the 
bottom of the Tools panel you see two overlapping colored squares. The one on top is the 
<b>foreground</b> 
color (in the example picture to the left it is the large black square), which is the color that all the drawing tools use. The one behind it 
(the large white square) is the 
<b>background</b> 
color, which is the color that the eraser uses on a layer that cannot be transparent. These colors 
can be changed by clicking on them (clicking on them opens the Color Picker, 
which is explained in more detail in <a href="step07.html">Step 07</a>). <span class="style1">
<font color="#000000">The little 
double-headed arrow icon above and to the right of these squares swaps the foreground and 
background colors</font></span>. The tiny black-over-white box above and to the left 
of the squares restores the foreground 
color to Black and the background color to White.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Options bar</b></p>
<p>When we select a tool, the top of Photoshop will offer up a group of options 
that allow us to customize the tool to complete a variety of tasks. Let's take a 
quick look at this area.</p>
<ol start="11">
  <li>Select the <b>Brush</b> tool. There's a bar near the 
  top of the screen that will change and look something like the image below...<br>
  <font color="#800000">
  <img border="0" src="01/110.jpg" width="641" height="35"></font></li>
</ol>
<p>This is the<b> Tools Options bar</b>. Although every tool in the Tool panel has its own set of 
options here, some are pretty common. On the very left is a pull down menu you can use to store 
presets of the current tool (it is that little arrow just to the right of 
the paintbrush in the image above), which is very useful for defining customized variations of a tool that 
you'll re-use a lot.  Mode: is another common one, and works a lot like the  mode of a layer 
(which we will cover later). 
We will want this set to Normal for most things that we do.</p>
<p><b>Panels</b></p>
<p>On the right side of the Photoshop screen you will see several different 
Panels, or small windows. There are quite of few of these Panels available in 
Photoshop (there are over 20 of them), and they will be of great importance to you as you 
work with Photoshop because they contain tools and information you will 
  use often. At this point you can see the Color, Libraries, and Layers panels. 
While the Libraries panel is useful, we will not be using it, so let's close it 
to get it out of the way.</p>
<ol start="12">
  <li>Click Window on the menu bar and click Libraries to remove the checkmark 
  and deactivate that panel...<br>
<img border="0" src="01/103.jpg" width="201" height="490"></li>
</ol>
<p>Two of the most important panels are Layers and History. It is a good idea 
  for the Layers 
  panel to be large, and 
  to know where the History panel is so you can quickly correct mistakes. To 
  bring up the History panel, you can click either the <span class="style1">
<font color="#000000">Expand Dock arrow to open all docked 
panels</font></span> (it is circled 
below)...</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="01/111.jpg" width="80" height="82"></p>
<p align="left">
  Or you can simply click the History icon 
pointed at with the arrow above to open only the History panel.</p>
<p align="left">
The History and Layer panels are indicated by red arrows below...</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="01/112.jpg" width="487" height="278"></p>
<p>You can rearrange these panels by dragging their tabs (the area that contains 
the name of the panel at the top) around. As you use Photoshop, you'll discover what Panels are most 
important to you, and you can place them where you like (for now, leave them 
alone).</p>
<p>
You will get a chance to work with many of Photoshop's Panels as you go through 
this tutorial, but let's take a quick second to have a closer look at the 
History panel...</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="01/113.jpg" width="208" height="273"></p>
<p>The <span class="style1"><font color="#000000">History Panel allows you to undo multiple actions all at once</font></span>. The list in the window shows the recent actions 
you've taken, with the most recent on the bottom. Clicking on previous steps undoes any actions done 
since that step (for example, if you click 4 steps up the list, Photoshop will undo everything you 
did after that point). The <span class="style1"><font color="#000000">shortcut to undo the very last action 
you did is </font> <b><font color="#000000">Ctrl+Z</font></b></span>, which is very 
useful when drawing (if you want to undo more than 1 action you have to use <b>
Ctrl+Alt+Z</b>, which is the Step Backwards keyboard shortcut). Keep in mind that every change you make to a graphic will be saved in the 
History panel, no matter how small the change. So if you make a large number of tiny changes you 
may have to go pretty far up the history list to undo them all.</p>
<p>By default, Photoshop remembers 50 history states (in other words, Photoshop 
remembers 50 changes you made, no matter how small, to your image). This is not 
a very large number of states (Photoshop has the ability 
to save up to 1,000 history states), especially if you are making lots and lots of 
changes to your image as we are going to do. Let's take a minute now to increase 
the number of history states Photoshop saves.</p>
<ol start="13">
  <li>Press <b>Ctrl+K</b> to open the Preference window and click <b>Performance</b>...<br>
  <img border="0" src="01/114.jpg" width="144" height="233"></li>
  <li>On the right side of the window locate the <b>
  History States:</b> option...<br>
  <img border="0" src="01/115.jpg" width="218" height="131"></li>
  <li>Select the current number of History States 
  (which should be 50, but don't freak out if it is a different number) and 
  change it to <b>100</b></li>
  <li>Click <b>OK</b></li>
  <li>Click the History panel's Docked Panel icon again to collapse the History 
  panel</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Status bar</b></p>
<p>The Status bar appears at the bottom of the Photoshop window (note that it is 
only visible when you have an image open)...</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="01/116.jpg" width="255" height="24"></p>
<p>On the far left of the Status bar is the current magnification level, which 
in the image above is 60.61%. This indicator is handy as you can click in the box 
and quickly type a new zoom level. Let's change the zoom to see how this works.</p>
<ol start="18">
  <li>Highlight the percentage currently in your zoom box 
  and type <b>20</b> (you do not have to 
  type the % sign)</li>
  <li>Press <b>Enter</b></li>
</ol>
<p>Your image should now be much smaller. Just to the right of the zoom is the 
document size indicator. The 
left value, which in our example above is 2.96 megabytes, indicates the size of 
the image file if all layers where flattened and the file where saved as a psd 
(more on what layers are and what a psd is later). The right value, which in our 
example above is also 2.96 megabytes (they are the same because we have yet to actually 
do anything to our image) 
indicates the size of the image with all layers intact. Keep in mind that these 
numbers are usually larger than the actual size of the image when you save 
it - usually, but not always.</p>
<p>On the far right of the Status bar you see an arrow, which indicates 
that if you click it a sub-menu will appear...</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="01/117.jpg" width="257" height="250"></p>
<p>This allows you to change what information appears on the Status bar. As you 
can see in the image above, Document Sizes is checked by default. We do not have 
time now to go through what all of the available options do, so if you are 
interested you'll need to hit the Internet and search for document status 
options.</p>
<hr>
<p>Before we move on to actually working with your face, let's take a look at a 
few additional useful keyboard shortcuts in Photoshop.</p>
<div align="center">
  <center>
  <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" width="61%">

    </tr>
  </table>
  </center>
</div>
<p>Each of these shortcuts will be discussed again as they are needed throughout 
this tutorial, but it is a good idea for you to be introduced to them now.</p>
<hr>
<p>After finishing this tutorial (and this course) you will be able to 
  manipulate 
  a wide variety of images. If fact, all kinds of strange images are possible by 
messing with graphics, as the images below demonstrate...</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="01/118.jpg" width="600" height="450" alt="Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!"></p>
<p>Don't worry, the guy on the ladder didn't get eaten. The image was created by 
  joining a photo of an Air Force helicopter during a water rescue training 
  mission in San Francisco with a photo of a shark breaching (jumping out of the water) off 
the coast of Africa. </p>
<p align="center">Or how about this one...</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="01/119.jpg" alt="Yummy" width="464" height="309"></p>
<p align="center">Or these...</p>
